###### Abstract

**Background** Among people living with HIV, elite controllers (ECs) maintain an undetectable viral load, even without receiving anti-HIV therapy. In non-EC patients, this therapy leads to marked improvement, including in immune parameters, but unlike ECs, non-EC patients still require ongoing treatment and experience co-morbidities. In-depth, comprehensive immune analyses comparing EC and treated non-EC patients may reveal subtle, consistent differences. This comparison could clarify whether elevated circulating interferon-alpha (iFNa) promotes widespread immune cell alterations and persists post-therapy, furthering understanding of why non-EC patients continue to need treatment.

**Methods** Levels of IFN\(\alpha\) in HIV-infected EC and treated non-EC patients were compared, along with blood immune cell subset distribution and phenotype, and functional capacities in some cases. In addition, we assessed mechanisms potentially associated with IFN\(\alpha\) overload.

**Results** Treatment of non-EC patients results in restoration of IFN\(\alpha\) control, followed by marked improvement in distribution numbers, phenotypic profiles of blood immune cells, and functional capacity. These changes still do not lead to EC status, however, and IFN\(\alpha\) can induce these changes in normal immune cell counterparts in vitro. Hypothesizing that persistent alterations could arise from inalterable effects of IFN\(\alpha\) at infection onset, we verified an IFN\(\alpha\)-related mechanism. The protein induces the HIV coreceptor CCR5, boosting HIV infection and reducing the effects of anti-HIV therapies. EC patients may avoid elevated IFN\(\alpha\) following on infection with a lower inoculum of HIV or because of some unidentified genetic factor.

**Conclusions** Early control of IFN\(\alpha\) is essential for better prognosis of HIV-infected patients.

**Keywords** Energy control of IFN\(\alpha\) is essential for better prognosis of HIV-infected patients.

have received anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and a comparison of these results with those of untreated EC patients. If therapy is interrupted in treated non-EC patients, HIV viremia rebounds, demonstrating that anti-HIV therapy is not curative. We show here that therapy removes the bulk of HIV-specific immune cell alterations while controlling IFNa levels, as seen in ECs; however, some residual alterations persist, likely because of IFNa effects before therapy. Furthermore, we identify the cause of the failure in non-ECs of IFNa to contain HIV in the earliest days of infection, which leads to a vicious cycle of IFNa response to increasing HIV titres and ultimately to pathologically high IFNa levels. In turn, non-EC patients sustain early immune cell damage that can persist in part even after therapeutic control of IFNa. Of note, as is usually the case, anti-HIV therapy in these patients was not begun in the earliest days of infection.

## Methods

### Human samples

A total of 73 Healthy donor (HD) samples were obtained through the Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Paris, France). 51 samples were used for serological analysis and 22 for phenotypic analysis. A total of 81 people living with HIV were recruited and subdivided into three groups: EC samples (\(n=18\)) were obtained from the Natural Viral Suppressures (i.e., NVS) cohort (Baltimore), untreated non-EC patient (UP) samples (n = 36) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Bethesda \(n=19\)) and from the Laboratoire de Reference SIDA (Liage \(n=17\)), and treated patient (TP) samples (\(n=27\)) from NIH (Bethesda \(n=19\)) and from Laboratoire de Reference SIDA (Liage \(n=8\)). Patient groups did not significantly differ in terms of age, gender, or disease status. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with protocols approved by the regional ethical research boards and the Declaration of Helsinki (H-29331 (USA) and 2020/418 (Belgium)). Clinical data are indicated in Supplementary Table 1a-c.

### Sample processing

Peripheral blood and serum were collected into appropriate tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, St Quentin en Yvelines, France). PBMCs were stored frozen in nitrogen liquid.

### Cell culture

CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells were isolated from frozen PBMCs. All CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells were positively selected with a CD4\({}^{+}\)T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotore, Bergisch-Glababah, Germany), yielding CD4\({}^{+}\)T cell populations at a purity of 96%-99%. Purified CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells were stimulated as described previously[33] with a \(\mu\)g/mL plate-bound anti-human CD3 (OKT3) monoclonal antibody (mAb; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and 4 ug/mL soluble anti-human CD28 (CD28.2) mAb (Becton Dickinson) in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukine, Chiron, Amsterdam, 100 U/mL) and recombinant human interferon alpha-2a (Referon-A 0.01-100 ng/mL). After 4 days of culture, membrane CCR5 and CXCR expression was measured by flow cytometry on CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells with an anti-CCR5 mAb (clone REA245 Miltenyi Biotec) and an anti-CXCR4 mAb (clone 12G5, BioLegend).

### Infectious molecular clones

The infectious molecular clone (IMC) of the CH058 transmitted/founder (T/F) virus (CCR5-tropic) was obtained from the NIH HIV Reagent Program (catalogue number: 11856). The CXCR-tropic T/F virus 40700, which is unable to use CCR5, was identified in an acute CRF01_AE infection. The full-length genome of the 4070 T/F virus was determined using single-genome amplification, as previously described[4]. Detailed information about the 40700 IMC, including the full-length viral sequence, will be described in a separate publication.

### Viral stock preparation and titration

To generate viral stocks, 6 ug of IMC was transfected into 293 T cells in a T25 flask using the FuGEN6 transfection reagent (Promega). Six hours post transfection, the culture medium containing the plasmids and the transfection reagent was completely replaced with 8 mL of fresh medium. The cells were cultured at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C for 3 days. Culture supernatants were harvested at 72 hours post transfection, filtered, and stored at \(-80\) \({}^{\circ}\)C until use. The infectious titres (TCD50) of the viral stocks were determined on TEM-bl cells.

### Determination of virus growth kinetics in PBMCs

Cry cryopreserved PBMCs from one HD were thawed and recovered overnight at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C in RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS. The next day, the cells were stimulated with 4 ug/mL plate-bounded anti-CD3 (clone QKT3, eBioscience) and 4 ug/mL soluble anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, eBioscience) in the presence of 100 U/mL IL-2 (Human IL-2 IS, Miltenyi Biotec) in a 96-well U-bottom plate at a density of \(0.3\times 10^{6}\) cells/well. To determine whether upregulation of CCR5 by IFNa could compromise the inhibitory effect of IFNa on HIV-1 replication, cells were pretreated with three different concentrations of IFNa (0.2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL) during the simulation step. Cells stimulated in the absence of IFNa (non-pretreated) were used as a control. Four days after stimulation, cells were washed twice to remove the stimulating antibodies and infected by the CH058 or 40700 T/F virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. At 4 h after infection at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C, cells were washed three times with RPMI1640. The infected cells were cultured in a 48-well plate with 500 \(\mu\)L RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL IL-2, and a corresponding concentration of IFNa (0.2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, or 5 ng/mL). As a positive control, infected cells (non-pretreated) were cultured in the absence of IFNa to allow determination of the normal replication kinetics of the virus. Culture supernatants were harvested at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post infection, and virus replication was determined by measuring the p24 concentration in the supernatants.

### Antibody panels, staining, and flow cytometry analysis

Immunophenotypic studies were performed on frozen samples, using flow cytometry panels with up to 23 colours. Approximately \(1\times 10^{6}\) to \(5\times 10^{6}\) frozen PBMCs were used per patient per stain. PBMCs were thawed using RPMI supplemented with 20% FCS per standard protocol. Cells were resuspended at 45 \(\mu\)L FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). To block FC receptor binding, 5 \(\mu\)L of FcB Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi, Paris, France) was added to the cells for 10 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before the staining. Staining was performed in several stages, depending on the number of antibodies. The first mAb cocktail for surface staining, prepared with brilliant vitole, brilliant vitole, and brilliant bath antibodies in Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences, Paris, France), was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C (see Supplementary Tables 2-4 for antibody panel information). Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before addition of the second mAb cocktail, which contained all other antibodies in FACS buffer for surface staining and viability staining, and incubated for 30 minutes at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. When needed, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eB Bioscience, Paris, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then stained for intracellular targets with the third mAb cocktail in the kit's permeabilization buffer. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and FACS buffer. Before use within this panel, all antibodies were titrated individually to identify the concentration that provided the maximal brightness of the positive cell population and the lowest signal for the negative cell population. Cells were acquired on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer. Data were analysed using flowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). The gating strategy used to identify the immune cell subtypes and their respective subsets is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unsupervised analyses were performed using Cytobank software and R studio software.

### Composite cell phenotypic alteration score

We generated a cumulative phenotypic score for each T cell subset. The frequencies of the following markers were used to calculate the score: CD25', CD26', HLA-DR', CD38', CTLA-4', CD28', PD1', and CD39'. This score was calculated as the sum of the ratio of marker expression level to the average expression level of the corresponding marker in the HD.

### Cytokine quantification

Serum IFNa and IFNa2 levels were determined using SIMOA cytokine assays (references 100806 and 101419, respectively). Van der Sluis et al. have reported that HIV infection of co-cultures of CD4 + T cells and plasmcytoid dendritic cells ([p]DCs) enhances expression of _IFNa2_ and not _IFNa1_ or _IFNa3_ mRNA, so we focused only on serum IFNa2 levels1.

IFNa-induced CD38 and HLA-DR. In contrast, GrzB, CD26, CD39, inhibitory Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR, and PD1 expression patterns on mature NKs from TPs and HDs are similar (Fig. 3aIV-aVI).

We next investigated the distribution of CD11c\({}^{+}\) myeloid DC (mDC) and CD123\({}^{+}\) pDC subsets in the three groups (Fig. 3b). Of note, the pDC frequency is reduced in both patient groups, although more so in UPs, and the mDC proportion also is increased in these groups, although more so in TPs (Fig. 3bII-bIII). The \(\forall\)S T cells, another subset of innate immune response cells, also show functional signalling receptor expression abnormalities (Fig. 3c) with IFNNa-induced HLA-DR, associated in some cases with CD38. These alterations are still significantly more frequent in TPs than in HDs but less than in UPs.

Collectively, these results show that immune cells involved in the innate phase of the immune response still present functional abnormalities in TPs compared with HDs, but at a lower level than in UPs.

### Residual T cell phenotypic profile abnormalities in TPs

To compare immune T cell profiles among UPs, TPs and HDs, we characterized the T cell subtype frequency and phenotypes, as described in the material and methods and elsewhere[1]. UPs have an abnormal T cell distribution compared with HDs. The frequency of CCR7\({}^{+}\) in CD3\({}^{+}\), CD4\({}^{+}\), and CD8\({}^{+}\)T cells (Fig. 4a) is decreased in UPs compared with HDs. This loss of T cells expressing CCR3 also is present in TPs, although to a lesser degree. Compared with HDs, UPs exhibit altered proportions of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminal differentiated EM CD45RA-expressing (TEMRA) cells among the CD4\({}^{+}\) (Fig. 4bI-bII) and CD8\({}^{+}\) (Fig. 4bIII-bIV) T cell subsets. TPs will show an abnormal differentiation profile but with normalization of their CM and EM CD8\({}^{+}\) frequencies. In addition, UPs compared with HDs exhibit an altered phenotypic profile in T cell subsets (Fig. 4c). This difference can be attributed in part to high IFNa levels[1]. These phenotypic alterations are characterized by an abnormal level of activation/differentiation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, CD25, CD26, CD28) and inhibitory receptors (CD39, PD1, CTLA4) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In general, in contrast to UPs, TPs display immune profiles that are similar to those of HDs. However, some CD8\({}^{+}\)T cell phenotypes in TPs, such as HLA-DR'CM, CD38\({}^{+}\)HLA-DR'EM, remain significantly different from those of HDs. After treatment, partial reversion of T cell phenotype anomalies in all CD4\({}^{+}\) and CD8\({}^{+}\)T cell subsets is observed, as evaluated using phenotypic alteration scores (see Methods) (Fig. 4cIII-dcfV). Interestingly, in UPs, expression levels of various markers associated with immune dysfunction in the CD4\({}^{+}\) and CD8\({}^{+}\) CM population are directly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 2aIV, 2bIV). This pattern is in keeping with the interpretation that these alterations are induced by a major mediator such as elevated IFNa. No such correlation is found in cells from TPs.

According to the phenotypic profile analysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the frequency of Tregs is greater in UPs compared with HDs (Fig. 5aI-all). This increase in Treg frequency, however, is not seen in TPs. In contrast, we found that after treatment, patients still have a high frequency of Tregs lacking CD25 expression[1], with a higher frequency of this CD25\({}^{\text{ns}}\) Treg variant in UPs (Fig. 5aIII-5aIV). This altered immune profile of memory Tregs observed in UPs is partially restored in TPs (Fig. 5aV).

CD8\({}^{+}\)T cell subsets from HIV-infected patients show quantitative and qualitative defects of differentiated CD8\({}^{+}\) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (KIR\({}^{+}\)) and cytotoxic CD8\({}^{+}\) suppressive T cells (CD8\({}^{+}\)supps, KIR\({}^{+}\)) in the TEMRA subset (Fig. 5b). In TPs compared with HDs, CTL is increased, with a concomitant reduction in CD8\({}^{+}\)supp (Fig. 5bI and bIII). These populations are similar in UPs and HDs. In addition, compared with HDs, UPs show a higher frequency of CTL and CD8\({}^{+}\)supp cells expressing various markers of activation, differentiation, and exhaustion, whereas TPs display a phenotypic pattern that is somewhat similar to that of HDs (Fig. 5bII, 5bIV).

Furthermore, IFNa-induced CD38 correlates with expression of inhibitory checkpoint proteins (CTLA-4 and PD1) in both CTL and CD8\({}^{+}\)supp in UPs, but not in TPs (_i.e._, after therapy) (Fig. 5bV).

In summary, the phenotypic anomalies associated with loss of immune cell function of conventional T cells (Tconvs) and Tregs are markedly reduced in TPs compared with UPs, although they show similar features between the two groups, and in large part these are proteins induced by IFNa. The CD8\({}^{+}\) functionally linked phenotypic alterations also are of the same nature as those in CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells but intensified, and they are markedly reduced after therapy. These immune alterations in both Tconv and CD8\({}^{+}\) cytotoxic T cells observed before therapy and still present after cART may account for the fragile health suggested by the comorbidities that persist or arise in TPs.

### TPs and ECs share immune profile features

We next analysed blood immune cell profiles in TPs compared with ECs (Fig. 6). viSNE and PCA analysis indicate that TPs and ECs display similar cell distributions that are distinct from those of UPs and HDs (Fig. 6aI-all). Both TPs and ECs also have normal background levels of serum IFNa. One difference between them is in ySt T cells (Fig. 6aII). There is no difference in the proportion of NK cell subsets between TPs and ECs, but TPs show a decrease in early NK cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6bI). Based on analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in mature NK cells, there is a higher frequency of CD38\({}^{+}\) HLA-DR' and PD1\({}^{+}\) cells in TPs and ECs than in HDs (Fig. 6bII). Interestingly, TPs and ECs also share a similar percentage of DCs (Fig. 6cI-clI). One difference in the DC compartment is a significant increase in the mDC subset in TPs. Dysregulation of T cell homooeostasis, as observed in untreated HIV -infected patients[3], is maintained in TPs compared with ECs, although to a lesser degree than the previous reported TPs have fewer CCR7\({}^{+}\) CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells than HDs (Fig. 6dI). Regarding CD8\({}^{+}\)T cells, TPs and ECs have decreased frequencies of CCR7\({}^{+}\)T cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6dII). Furthermore, the few T cell phenotypic alterations seen in TPs and ECs are similar (Fig. 6eI, fI and Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, analysis of Treg cells reveals that their frequencies are similar among the three groups (Fig. 6eII). Of note, TPs and ECs show an increase in the CD25\({}^{\text{ns}}\) Treg variant compared with HDs (Fig. 6eII). Within CD8\({}^{+}\)TEMRA, TPs and ECs show an increase in CTLs (Fig. 6fII) with a concomitant decrease in CD8\({}^{+}\)supp cells (Fig. 6fIII) compared with HDs. The anomalies observed in TPs and ECs are much less pronounced than in UPs but slightly higher than in HDs (Fig. 6f IV-f V and Supplementary Fig. 3).

Collectively, these data show that compared with UPs, TPs and ECs do not express abnormally high levels of serum IFNa, avoiding the pathogenic IFNa effects on immune cells[4]. Particularly notable is the marked improvement in early effective NK cells and the later developing effective antigen-specific HLA-1-restricted CD8\({}^{+}\) CTL and HLA-E-restricted CD8\({}^{+}\)supp cells in TPs and ECs. However, these improvements do not completely restore immune status to that of HDs.

## Discussion

Advances in HIV therapy have derived from understanding the molecular events of virus replication and targeting one or more stages with specific

Multiple group comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison testing. Values are medians and \(p\) values (\({}^{*}p<0.05\), \({}^{*}p<0.01\), \({}^{**}p<0.001\), drugs. However, therapy is needed throughout life for those who are not ECs. In addition to developing long-lasting therapies and perhaps targeting the integrated HIV proviral DNA of HIV reservoir cells, alternative approaches are needed. In agreement with the consortium of collaborators working on the ECs (EC consortium) [1], we think a deeper understanding of HIV pathogenesis and how these pathogenic mechanisms do not arise in ECs may be key to advances that could allow for >99% of infected non-EC patients to convert to EC status without treatment and possibly be functionally cured.

Abundant evidence shows that the key events leading to either HIV progression and AIDS or a favourable clinical outcome are predicated on the events of early infection [1]. What that early damage is and its prognostic underpinnings have been unclear. The first signs are the peak HIV viremia and subsequent virus set point. These develop during the initial stage of the immune response, at the time innate immunity kicks in. If not kept under tight control, a high HIV level leaves its mark on future developments. HIV kills infected CD4\({}^{+}\)T cells, chiefly after antigen activation [8]. A small percentage of macrophages also are

infected, but most avoid cytopathic effects[77], and other immune cells are not infected. It is evident, though, that there is much more to the story, and many reports have shown that despite being uninfected, other immune cells may not function normally. The implication is the existence of some unidentified critical mediator(s) of these effects, acting very early in infection, which excludes candidates involved in specific adaptive immune responses and the inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic stages. Instead, this mediator must be active at the innate stage of the immune response (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Our results and previous reports lead us to conclude that the main mediator is elevated levels of IFNa[4]. Negative effects associated with IFNa have been described, but usually with the protein as one of several cytokines and acting in a general way to promote inflammation, as occurs in later stages of HIV infection. The details in our reports show that IFNa is more important in an early and specific disease stage. Other contributors to innate immunity are the NK cells. More than 99% of infected persons do not have adequate early control of HIV, so that HIV progression has a tailwind as time passes. As we describe in an accompanying paper [14] and in this report, both NK cells and IFNa show major abnormalities after infection in UPs. NK cells remain unaffected in ECs [4] and are markedly improved in non-EC patients after therapy, as shown here. In these non-ECs, treated patients, NK cells exhibit specific features of normal NK cells, especially in the setting of HLA-B57. Undoubtedly, NK cells are key in the control of HIV in the earliest days after infection. IFNa levels are highly correlated from an early period in UPs, in direct correlation with the HIV titere [25, 26]. In the specific case of HIV, IFNa is not an especially effective antiviral because it concomitantly induces high expression of the HIV co-receptor CCR5, as we show here (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, as we have previously reported, this treatment reduces HIV-inhibitory beta chemokines [26]. In the current work, we demonstrate that in untreated HIV-infected non-EC patients (i.e., UPs), all peripheral blood immune cells at all stages of the immune response show abnormalities in distribution numbers and immune phenotype. Of note, these abnormalities can be induced by elevated IFNa levels, as described in our companion paper and in other specific cases, as we and others have reported [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, cytokines to dangerous inflammation in the later stages of infection with some viruses. Our results here are directed to a newly characterized, early, and continuous solo pathogenic effect of IFNa. These results position increased IFNa as a key direct mediator of HIV pathogenesis, in addition to its known direct HIV effect. The IFNa effect develops along with HIV expansion early after infection and continues through progression to AIDS unless treatment is initiated, except in the case of ECs. As we hypothesize here, this IFNa effect can be avoided in such cases because of low-inculum infection. We emphasize that beyond ART, therapy should include temporarily targeting elevated systemic IFNa as soon as HIV seropositivity is known. This strategy may offer a way to reduce measurable HIV proviral DNA intact sequences down to the EC level [14, 15] while concomitantly providing non-harmful anti-viral IFNa to control other viral infections. Our hope is that this approach will lead to the end of further need for ART, i.e., a functional cure, in keeping with the direction promoted by Walker and colleagues [1].
