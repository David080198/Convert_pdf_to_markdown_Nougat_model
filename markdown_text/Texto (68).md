with cytotrophoblastic coating, and the presence of syncytial trophoblastic penetration into the myometrium suggested diagnosis of EPS. The pathologist suggests monitoring of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) due to suspected trophoblastic disease. The cytogenetic exam showed a trisomy 15.

Forty days after hysterectomy, the patient had an hCG blood level of 1,258 mU/mL. In transvaginal ultrasound we found an intrauterine gestational sac with an embryo with cardiac activity; CRL measurement was 3.1 mm. The pregnancy proceeded regularly. The patient underwent an elective cesarean section 39 weeks due to the history of previous cesarean section. The baby was appropriate for gestational age with a normal pH after delivery. No placental afterbirth complications were noted. The histopathologic exam of placenta was normal.

## Conclusion

EPS is a non-neoplastic trophoblastic lesion characterized by exuberant infiltration of the myometrium by trophoblasts at the implantation site. This lesion was first defined as syncytial endometrits, but the term "Exaggerated placental Site" is now commonly used. EPS may develop secondary to a normal pregnancy, miscarriage, cervical pregnancy or hydididiform mole (1). The several reports describe the clinical course of EPS, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings or histopathological characteristics (3), but this case report is the first description of hysteroscopic findings of EPS.

In the present case we performed hysteroscopic surgery after miscarriage with detection of an unusual intracavitary topography and presentation of significant amount of gestational tissue. It has been shown that hysteroscopic approach is an effective routine and safe procedure based on the tissue removal inside the uterus; Cholkeri-Singh et al (4) have shown that the detection of fetal chromosomes obtained from direct hysteroembryoscopic biopsies resulted in more accurate karyotyping with lower maternal cell contamination than those obtained from curettage material. Hysteroscopic evacuation of the uterine cavity may reduce the D&C complication such as uterine perforation and endometrial damage in order to preserve future fertility.

By performing the procedure under direct visualization focusing on the implantation site, we can obtain precise sampling of trophoblastic tissue. On hysteroscopic view the uterine wall demonstrates trophoblastic tissue present in all uterine wall with increased vascularization. No invasive signs were noted and during the hysteroscopic resection no cleavage was found between the material and myometrium. During surgery there was plentiful bleeding but without the need for further intervention of drugs. In order to preserve fertility, the subendometrial glands were left intact. We use hyaluronic acid gel to prevent intrauterine adhesion formation after complete evacuation of the uterine cavity. In the case report the presence of hCG 40 days after hysteroscopy alerted us to the possible presence of a malignant trophoblastic lesion as placental site trophoblastic tumors (PSTT) but elevated hCG was due to an early gestation.

Cytogenetic analysis showed trisomy 15. In literature we found other reports where GTD was associated with alteration of number of chromosomes. Trisomy 8, 13 or 21 was described with GTD (5, 6). In our case the pregnancy occurred after the hysteroscopy treatment and had a regular course. We were on alert for the possibility of bleeding after placenta delivery according to reports in literature. In fact EPS could lead to severe postpartum hemorrhage also with necessity of hysterectomy (1, 7). The cesarean section of our patient occurred without complications, confirming a complete removal of EPS with previous hysteroscopic treatment.

EPS is a rare trophoblastic lesion but in the suspicion of non-malignant trophoblastic disease, hysteroscopic treatment should be considered.

Hysteroscopy seems to be a safe and feasible procedure and could be considered in selected cases, such as in young women with desire of fertility preservation.
