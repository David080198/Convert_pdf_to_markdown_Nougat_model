###### Abstract

Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) occurs because of an immune-mediated reaction to gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. In clinical practice, there are often difficulties in diagnosing celiac disease, particularly in patients without specific gastrointestinal complaints. Rarely, celiac disease can present with acute symptoms, delaying diagnosis and exposing these patients to possible life-threatening complications. In this article, we present a review of the literature and a case report demonstrating the usefulness of intestinal ultrasound in the primary diagnosis of celiac disease, followed by complete confirmation of the diagnosis by enteroscopy with biopsy and serologic diagnostics.

C 2023 10.

patient suffered from viral hepatitis A in childhood. At the time of the examination, she was periodically observed by a gynecologist for uterine myoma. Laboratory studies revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin: 96 g/L), thrombocytosis (platelets: 490 x 10 x 9/l), elevated D-dimer -1139 ug/mL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate acceleration up to 21 mm/h. In addition, the patient had hypoproteinemia (total protein: 57.12 g/l). Studies of stool samples revealed mild excretory pancreatic insufficiency (pancreatic elastase: 159.26 ug/g) and normal levels of calprotection (11.86 ng/m). Taking into account the duration of the disease and violation of nutritional status, the patient was hospitalized in the therapeutic department for additional examination and selection of therapy. During hospitalization, the infectious nature of the pathology was excluded (fecal tests). Routine abdominal ultrasound without any features The patient was decided to undergo an intestinal ultrasound, which revealed an expansion of the ileal cavity with clearly defined circular folds - jejunum (Figure 1), in connection with which the patient was suspected of enteropathy.

For a more accurate assessment of the condition of the gastrointestinal tract, the patient underwent endoscopic examinations with biopsy sampling. Ileocolonoscopy revealed sluggish peristalsis in the colon in all its departments without mucosal defects. However, thickening and shortening of the willi in the ileum were observed in the small intestine, and more proximal, in the jejunum, confluent lesions with low, inactive willi were visualized, indicating focal atrophy of the small intestine. On esophagagostroudonedoscopy with enteroscopy, the esophagus and stomach were unremarkable. The mucosa of the duodenal bulb was thinned, and the velvet was sharply smoothed out with linear areas of atrophy; this process extended to the subbombous sections. The small intestine was examined down to the lower third of the jejunum. The mucosa was thinned over the entire examined area, and the willi were thickened, low, and immobile (Figure 2). Folding was preserved. Based on the described picture, an endoscopic conclusionis as follows: "atrophic duodenitis, jejunumis" was made, and biopsy material was taken.

After endoscopic examination, celiac disease was suspected, so serological diagnostics were performed, as a result of which positive antibodies to TG2, gliadin, and endomysium were detected.

On pathohistological examination of biopsy specimens of the jejunum, the villi were dilated, flattened, and lined with rimmed enterocytes with a moderate number of goblet cells; the number of intraepithelial lymphocytes was up to 50 per 100 enterocytes; the ratio of the height of the villi to the depth of the crypts was 2:1; the crypts were deep and filled with border enterocytes, goblet cells, and Paneth cells; the lamina propria was moderately infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasmocytes with an admixture of eosinophils [4]. Histopathological conclusion: "the morphological picture of chronic atrophic lymphocytic duodenitis corresponds to gluten-sensitive enteropathy type 3b, according to Marsh-Oberhuber (Figure 3)." Thus, the patient was diagnosed with celiac disease and was transferred to a gluten-free diet and discharged with further recommendations. Taking into account the duration of the disease, systemic steroids (methylprednisolone) were prescribed for up to 12 weeks.

## Discussion

Today, ultrasound examination of organs is widely used in medicine for screening before the appointment of invasive and expensive diagnostic procedures. Intestinal ultrasound is mainly used to diagnose and monitor patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Various ultrasound features associated with celiac disease have already been described in the literature, and the recent advent of high-frequency transducers (5-12 MHz) has made it possible to assess the condition of the loops of the small intestine and abdominal cavity using this method [5]. Using ultrasound as the first (non-invasive) line of diagnosis, including in clinically asymptomatic patients with untreated celiac disease, it is possible to determine several sonographic signs characteristic of this disease [6]:

* Increased fluid content in moderately dilated intestinal loops (25-35 mm) with fasting hyperperistalsis;
* Slightly thickened wall of the small intestine (3-5 mm) and thickened cuspid valves, most often observed in patients with untreated celiac disease;
* A decrease in the number of folds of the jejunum and an increase in the folds of the ileum (jejunization of the ileum);
* Periodic invasion due to hyperperistalsis;
* Presence of slightly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.

Therefore, intestinal ultrasonography may help avoid delaying the diagnosis, especially in patients with atypical clinical manifestations of celiac disease. This is a promising method with high sensitivity and specificity. Although the gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease is histological confirmation of bowel involvement in serologically positive individuals, expanding the range of diagnostic options for clinically asymptomatic patients with untreated celiac disease is possible through ultrasound diagnostics. The limitation may be the lack of experts with the skill of ultrasound diagnostics of the pathology of the abdominal cavity and intestines.
