diameter was detected by spinal MRI (Figure 2). Neurosurgery performed an immediate laminectomy and tumor excision with no postoperative sequelae. Histopathological examination revealed a cellular neoplasm with extensive calcification and an infiltrative pattern consistent with breast carcinoma metastasis. Immunohistochemistryistochemical staining revealed that cells were diffusely strongly positive for ER, negative for PR, and positive (3+) for HER2. Subsequently, 30 Gy RT was administered to the T11-L2 region in 10 fractions. With the postoperative RT and subsequent physiotherapy program, the patient's muscle strength increased to 5/5 in all four limbs, sensation improved, and bowel functions returned to normal. No recurrence was detected during the 6-month follow-up of the patient on trastuzumab plus perutzumab and anastrozole maintenance therapy.

## 6 Discussion

ISGM is underestimated in clinical practice, especially on pre-MRI dates. The incidence of IGM increases with increasing cancer morbidity and prolongation of patient survival [7]. Conus medullaris metastasis has rarely been reported as a case series in patients with breast cancer of various hormonal and genetic status [8, 9]. For the first time, conus medullaris metastasis was detected in our patient with ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-positive breast cancer.

Most patients with IGM usually present with myelopathy as the first sign, such as hemiparests and hemiparesthesia [10]. Urinary and bowel dysfunctions can also be encountered. Although primary IGM tumors present with slower progression, metastatic lesions often present with neurological deficits or rapidly developing complete parapelegia [11, 12]. Our patient who presented with parapelegia and bowel dysfunction had a clinical presentation similar to that of a case series in the literature [4, 7].

Although RT, chemotherapy, and surgical resection are clinically viable options, the management of IGM remains controversial. RT is the first-line treatment for IGM for radiosensitive metastases such as small cell lung carcinoma, breast cancer, or lymphoma [13]. However, the response to RT applied after the development of parapelegia was weak. Surgical treatment can be performed in selected patients. Kalacyci et al. [7] suggested that early surgical resection resulted in regression of neurological deficits and improved quality of life in these patients. In our patient, surgery was preferred in the early period because of parapelegia. Because patients with IGM may develop permanent neurological deficits, they should be evaluated promptly. Appropriate treatment should be administered as RT, chemotherapy, or surgery [14]. Otherwise, irreversible neurological damage that affects patients' quality of life may develop.

Compared with other forms of breast cancer, HER2-positive breast tumors typically tend to be more aggressive [14]. Although central nervous system (CNS) metastases are more common in HER2-positive breast cancers, data on conus medullaris metastases are limited. In this case with CNS metastasis, conus medullaris metastasis occurred during follow-up. In the case series of 7 breast cancer patients by Hsu et al. [15], four patients had CNS, bone, or lung metastases at the time of IGM diagnosis. In our patient, CNS metastasis developed before IGM. Because most patients are symptomatic, information about the necessity of spinal imaging in asymptomatic breast cancer patients with CNS metastases is limited. However, early diagnosis can reduce morbidity by providing an early treatment. Therefore, it may

 be useful to question the neurological symptoms carefully and not skip the neurological examination.

In conclusion, the presented case demonstrates the feasibility and optimal response of surgery and RT in breast cancer patients with conus medullary metastasis. It should be kept in mind that conus medullary metastasises may develop in addition to CNS metastases in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Because this patient presented with neurological symptoms, it was easy to detect conus medullary metastasis. However, there is a need for case series with large numbers of HER2-positive breast cancers with ICM detected by imaging in the asymptomatic period.
