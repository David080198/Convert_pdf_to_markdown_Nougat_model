###### Abstract

Background High prostate eicosapentaenoic fatty acid (EPA) levels were associated with a significant reduction of upgrading to grade group (GG) \(\geq\) 2 prostate cancer in men under active surveillance. We aimed to evaluate the effect of MAG-EPA long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplement on prostate cancer proliferation.

Methods A phase Il double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 130 men diagnosed with GG \(\geq\) 2 prostate cancer and undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2015-2017 (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02333435). Participants were randomized to receive 3 g daily of either MAG-EPA (\(n=65\)) or placebo (\(n=65\)) for 7 weeks (range 4-10) prior to radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was the cancer proliferation index quantified by automated image analysis of tumor nuclear Ki-67 expression using standardized prostatectomy tissue microarrays. Additional planned outcomes at surgery are reported including plasma levels of 27 inflammatory cytokines and fatty acid profiles in circulating red blood cells membranes and prostate tissue.

Results Cancer proliferation index measured by Ki-67 expression was not statistically different between the intervention (3.10%) and placebo (2.85%) groups (\(p=0.64\)). In the _per protocol_ analyses, the adjusted estimated effect of MAG-EPA was greater but remained non-significant. Secondary outcome was the changes in plasma levels of 27 cytokines, of which only L-7 was higher in MAG-EPA group compared to placebo (\(p=0.026\)). Men randomized to MAG-EPA prior to surgery had four-fold higher EPA levels in prostate tissue compared to those on placebo.

Conclusions This MAG-EPA intervention did not affect the primary outcome of prostate cancer proliferation according to nuclear Ki-67 expression. More studies are needed to decipher the effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation in men with prostate cancer.

Globally every year, 1.4 M men are diagnosed with prostate cancer[1], prompting important life-changing decisions as treatments harbor risks of adverse effects and are costly[2]. Lifestyle factors are thought to impact prostate cancer risk and progression[1]. A diet rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC\(\alpha\)3), mainly found in seafood and fatty fish, could benefit prostate cancer patients, possibly by modulating tissue inflammation[3]. Observational studies have shown mixed results regarding associations between LC\(\alpha\)3 and prostate cancer risk[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 8

## Outcomes

### Assessment of Ki-67.

We built tissue micro-arrays (TMA) of patient's primary, secondary tumor grade regions and benign prostate tissue. One to three paraffin blocks containing tumor and/or normal tissue were selected for each patient. All tumor slides were examined and graded by a pathologist. Spots were selected from hematoxylin and eosin slides to represent the proportion of each Gleason pattern amongst dominant nodules and include a tertiary pattern when present in sufficient quantity. To build the TMA, four representative 1 mm tumor cores (two primary Gleason pattern cores and two secondary Gleason pattern cores) as well as two normal zones close to and away from the tumor (tumor-proximal and tumor-distal, respectively) were taken and placed on a recipient paraffin block along with appropriate alignment and controls using a tissue arrayer (Becher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA).

Sections of five micron-thick were cut from the TMA blocks to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a clinical pathology Dako platform. All sections were deparaffinized and heat-induced antigen retrieval with PT Link (PT-11\(\mu\)PT10027, Agilent) in Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution High pH (\(\mu\)K8004, Agilent). Ready-to-use monoclonal mouse antibody clone MIB-1 was used for Ki-67 antigen (\(\mu\)IR626, Agilent) with Autostainer Link48 instrument (\(\mu\)SA480 Agilent) for 20 min. Slides were counterstaineded with Harris hematoxylin. Digital images of IHC-stained TMA slides were obtained at 20X magnification using a slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0 HT; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ, USA).

The primary outcome for the study was nuclear expression of Ki-67 in tumor cells assessed as a percentage of tumor cells using an automated image analysis approach. We previously showed that this measure was associated with prostate cancer specific survival and highly correlated to an experienced duplicated manual counting[2]. Automated IHC analysis was performed using Calopix 3.2.0 software (TRIBVN healthcare, France). For the purpose of tissue recognition and segmentation, we used a morphometry algorithm by image learning to create a tissue mask and keeping only the tumor and normal epithelial component for analysis. Then, the Calopix -immuno-objects software was applied to each segment. The algorithm used allowed recognition of individual nuclei objects by isolating brown (DAB-stained) and blue (hematoxylin counter-stained) nuclei and reported their numbers. For each tissue core, the total number of objects detected (cell nuclei) and the percent of immunostated objects were computed. We performed five different algorithms to get a global Ki-67 score for each core. We then averaged the Ki-67 score of the patient's TMA cores to get a total, primary, secondary, and benign tissue Ki-67 score for each patient. Ki-67 analysis were performed without knowledge of intervention group.

### Inflammatory mediators

The plasma levels of 27 cytokines were measured using a 27-plex human cytokine kit (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay from Bio-Rad #X500KCAF0Y0), which measures levels of IL-18, IL-19, IL-2, IL-12, IL-14, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (790), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotax-1, hPG, G-CSF, GM-CSF, l-7, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-14, MIP-19, TNF-A, VEGF, IP-10, PDGF-BB, and RANTES, according to manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine levels were measured at study baseline and at surgery. The Assays were run on Bio-Plex* 200 Systems and data analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager[2] Software 6.1 Build 727. The changes of each cytokine between radical prostatectomy and study baseline was calculated, and the mean of change was reported for both groups.

### Tissue levels of EPA in prostatectomy and RBC membranes

Fatty acid profiles in RBC were assessed at baseline and on the day of surgery. Fatty acid profiles were also assessed in snap frozen prostate tissue at surgery. Since a previous study in a similar population showed no difference between benign and malignant tissue fatty acid profiles[2], prostate tissues for these analyses were all collected from the left anterior region of the prostate gland. Fatty acid profiles were determined by gas-chromography mass-spectrometry after total lipid extraction according to a modified Fold method[3] as described previously[4]. Briefly, lysates were isolated by centrifugation and washed with NaCl solution. A solution of chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) was used to extract the lipids from both erythrocyte membranes and tumors with phosphatidylcholine C21:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), as an internal standard. Fatty acid profiles were obtained after methylation in methanol/benzene 4:1 (v/ v) mixed with acetyl chloride[2] and separation by capillary gas chromatography using a temperature gradient on a HP5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a HP-88 capillary column (100 m x 0.25 mm id. x 0.20 mm film thickness Agilent Technologies) coupled to a flame ionization detector. Identification of fatty acids were done according to retention time using standard mixtures: FAK2 37 mix (Supelco Inc, Bellefonte, PA), GLC-411 FA mix (NuChek Prep Inc, Elysian, MN), as well as 22:5n-6 (Laroadan AB, Malmo, Sweden) and 22:5n-3 (Supelco Inc). Fatty acid content is expressed as relative percentages of total fatty acids for RBC and prostate tissue, as well as milligrams of fatty acids per gram of prostate tissue.

### Clinical and pathological outcomes

As routinely performed, cancer grade and stage were assessed at study baseline (last biopsy leading to enrollment) and on prostatectomy specimens. Cancer grade was evaluated by a pathologist using the ISUP grading system[5][6]. Central pathology review of all biopsy and prostatectomy cases was performed by a dedicated uro-pathologist blinded on intervention group and on biopsy findings.

### Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan was previously published[7]. We used an intention-to-treat approach including all analyzable patients for whom a Ki-67 percentage could be obtained. Average Ki-67 expression from the four tumor cores at prostatectomy, expressed as a percentage of tumor cells, were compared between the intervention and placebo group using two-sided \(T\)-tests. Average Ki-67 expression from the two primary tumor cores and the two benign cores were also analyzed. Sensitivity analysis testing the individual Ki-67 analysis algorithms were conducted. Ki-67 measure was log-transformed because its distribution was positively skewed.

Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for patients' characteristics that were found to be unbalanced at study baseline (age, BMI, PSA, GG, clinical stage). Covariates were removed if they did not change the effect estimate of the study arm. All final models were adjusted for baseline GG, PSA and clinical T stage. Ki-67 was log-transformed and subtracting one to the exponentiation of the treatment effect corresponds to the Ki-67 relative change (%) in the treatment group compared to placebo. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted using the GLM procedure in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). _Per protocol_ analyses were also performed among patients who adhered to the intervention and placebo by taking at least 80% of their capsules for the first three months for outcomes at prostatectomy.

Preplanned subgroup analyses by baseline \(L\)_ca3_ were not carried out because of missing values in the web-FPG for some participants (23%). Subgroup analyses were therefore based on RBC fatty acids (%) at baseline which we showed to be correlated with diet in the previous month[8]. The median was used as a cut point. Analyses were also presented stratified by baseline biopsy grade. Subgroup analyses were performed using the same multivariable linear regression described above with the addition of an interaction term. Bilateral _p_-values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

For secondary outcome analysis, the change in cytokine levels were compared between groups using \(T\)-test, or the non-parametric Flipfer-Policello test when data transformation to achieve normality was not possible. We had planned[7] to use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, but the variance and or the distribution shape was not similar for most cytokines. Thus, for simplicity, the Fligner-Policello test was used. We attempted to normalize the distribution of cytokine level data using simple approaches (e.g. Log(2), Log(10), square-root,...), box-plot[8] and more complex procedures such as the COMBAT procedure using the "_su_" and "_dbromm_" R package[9][10]. The latter also accounts for batch effect correction. Unfortunately, none of these transformations reached the goal of normalizing the cytokine level data as tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test.

All data processing steps and statistical analyses were performed in the R v4.1.1 statistical environment (http://www.r-project.org).

### Sample size

Sample size analysis was done using a two-sample \(t\)-test for a log-normal geometric mean ratio with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming equal variances, for the primary outcome, the percentage of tumor cells expressing Ki-67. In the study conducted by Aronson et al. [23], a statistically significant reduction of 32% in the proportion of cells expressing Ki-67 was observed in a group receiving a low-fat diet supplemented with fish oil compared to a control group assigned to a Western diet. We determined that, for the primary outcome, a total of 126 patients (63/group) will provide 90% power [53, 54] to detect a mean ratio of the proportions of cancer cells expressing Ki-67 of \(\approx\)0.8, i.e. a 20% difference across groups. Based on previous studies [235], a coefficient of variation of 0.4 was assumed. Considering previous low trial dropout rates (\(<\)3%), the target sample size was established at 130 participants (65 per group).

### Reporting summary

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

## Results

Participants were recruited between February 12, 2015 and June 9, 2017. Trial ended when the target sample size was reached. A total of 397 patients were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Among them, 159 did not meet the inclusion criteria for reasons detailed in Fig. 1.

After randomization, only two patients dropped out (1.5%) before surgery in the intervention arm and three participants in each arm were also excluded because the tumor size was too small or an insufficient quantity of tissue was available in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy for tissue microarray (TMA). One last participant of the placebo group was excluded from analysis because of invalid staining issue on TMA. The additional exclusions were not related to the intervention. A total of 61 patients in the placebo group and 60 patients in the intervention group were included in the _intention-to-treat_ analysis for the primary endpoint.

All randomized patients were included for the reported secondary analysis. All patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in the exploratory analyses.

### Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. Compared to the group allocated to placebo, patients in the MAG-EPA intervention group were more likely to have a biopsy GG\(\,\)\(\geq\,\)4 (25.0% compared to 9.8%). Accordingly, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were, on average, higher in patients allocated to the intervention group (mean = 8.69 ng/mL) compared to patients allocated to placebo (mean = 6.69 ng/mL). Compared to placebo, patients in the intervention arm were older (64.9 vs 62.7 years' old), had a slightly higher BMI (28.75 vs 27.45 kg/m2), and slightly lower EPA level in RBC membranes (0.73 vs 0.80 %). Other characteristics were similarly distributed across groups, including other fatty acid levels in RBC membranes at study baseline (Table 1).

A validated web-based food frequency questionnaire (web-FFQ\({}^{(\pm 4)}\)) was completed by 100/130 (77%) of participants at study baseline. The mean intake of fat, carbohydrates, and proteins expressed as a percentage of total energy intake, was \(33\pm 5\%\), \(48\pm 7\%\), and \(16\pm 2\%\), respectively, for an average daily energy intake of \(2330\pm 745\) kcal. These values are in line with recent healthy dietary recommendations [53, 54]. The mean omega-\(3\) dietary fatty acid ratio at baseline was \(6.3\pm 1.8\) which translated into a mean omega-omega3 ratio in the RBC membranes of \(3.7\pm 0.64\).

### Intervention

The duration of the intervention prior to surgery was not different for both groups with an average duration of \(52.0\pm 19.6\) days for placebo group and \(53.2\pm 37.4\) days for MAG-EPA group (Table 2). Successful implementation of dosing regimen was similar between the two groups with 79% of patients

in each group taking at least 80% of the study measured by pharmacy pill count. Adherence to intervention (% of taken pills) was similar across groups (87.5% placebo vs 90% MAG-EPA).

Cancer proliferation index

intention-to-treat analysis. Average Ki-67 expression in prostate tumor tissue was 3.10% in the intervention arm and 2.85% in the placebo arm (Table 3). The difference was not statistically significant (\(p\) = 0.66). Adjustment for GG, PSA and stage yielded a non-significant reduction of Ki-67 in the MAG-EPA arm (relative difference of \(-5.6\%\), 95%CI: \(-15.8\) to \(5.7\), \(p\) = 0.64). Sensitivity analysis during for age and BMI provided similar results. Analyses restricted to primary tumor cores for the Ki-67 assessment also provided similar non-significant results. Analyses stratified by baseline GG and levels of RBC omega-3 fatty acids (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) showed that the intervention was similarly non-significant across all groups.

Per protocol analysis.Among participants taking at least 80% of study capsules, the average Ki-67 expression in prostate tumor tissue was 3.00% in the intervention arm and 2.90% in the placebo arm (\(p\) = 0.94, Table 3).

Adjusted analyses showed a non-significant Ki-67 reduction in the MAG-EPA arm (relative difference of \(-14.0\%\), 95%CI: \(-34.0\) to 12.1, \(p\) = 0.41). Pre-planned analyses stratified by baseline GG and levels of RBC omega-3 fatty acids (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) showed that the intervention was similarly non-significant across all groups.

### Systemic inflammatory profile

As planned secondary outcome, inflammatory-related markers were profiled in the plasma of participants at study baseline and at surgery (Table 4). Baseline levels were similar between both groups for all cytokines measured (Supplementary Table 5). From the 27 cytokines measured, only the change of IL-level after 7 weeks of intervention was significantly different between MAG-EPA and placebo groups (Fig. 2, \(p\) = 0.026). However, this difference was not significant among participants taking at least 80% of study capsules (_per protocol_ analysis, \(p\) = 0.055, Supplementary Table 5).

### Effect of the intervention on RBC and tissue EPA content

At prostatectomy, the EPA content (% of total fatty acids) in RBC membranes was significantly higher in the intervention group (2.77% in MAG-EPA group versus 0.79% in placebo, \(p\) < 0.0001) as well as in the prostate tissue (1.03% in MAG-EPA versus 0.26% in placebo, \(p\) < 0.0001) (Table 2, Fig. 3a, b), while the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content was unchanged (Fig. 3c, \(p\) = 0.81).

### Pathological outcomes

Clinical outcomes at prostatectomy are presented in Table 5. In contrast to baseline biopsy, prostatectomy grading was more similar between groups.

 analyses, but the differences remained not significant. Compared to placebo, the change in IL-7 level was higher in MAG-EPA group. We showed that a daily dose of three grams of MAG-EPA during 7 weeks on average significantly increased fourfold the EPA level in prostate tissue compared to placebo.

This study showed that MAG-EPA supplement intervention is feasible, tolerated and acceptable to patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Most participants who were treated by prostatectomy (\(n=128\)) had a successful implementation of dosing regimen (79% taking at least 80% of their capsules in the first 3 months of study) and good adherence to intervention (% of taken pills) despite the absence of follow-up contacts during the intervention. This low-intensity compliance follow-up in our trial is closer to real world practice and contrasts with a previous pre-prostatectomy trial of shorter duration (31 days versus 52 days in our trial) whereby patients "were contacted weekly by study staff to reinforce compliance". EPA levels in RBC membranes and prostate tissue, both increased following the intervention, which also support the feasibility of MAG-EPA supplementation. Changing individuals' diet is difficult, hence the popularity of dietary supplements in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first study measuring the modulation of a specific fatty acid subtype at the absolute level, not only relative level, in the targeted prostate tissue.

The effect of an omega-3 diet on prostate cancer proliferation was previously studied by Aronson et al. [10] in a phase II randomized controlled trial comparing a low-fat diet enriched with fish oil to a controlled western diet for 4-6 weeks, in \(55\) prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy [11]. As a secondary outcome, Ki-67 expression was significantly lower in the low-fat fish oil-supplemented group compared to the western diet group. An important difference between that trial and ours is related to the diet. In the Aronson trial, the control group was under a supervised western diet trying to achieve a 15:1 omega/omega3 fatty acid ratio, suspected to be deleterious for prostate cancer, while the control was a neutral placebo in our trial. The mean omega-6-omega-3 dietary fatty acid ratio at baseline was \(6.3\pm 1.8\) in our cohort compared to 9.6 pre-intervention in their trial [10]. This omega-6-omega-3 ratio in RBC stayed the same for the placebo group overtime (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{**Characteristics of the intervention**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{**Placebo (\(n=61\))**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{**MAG-EPA (\(n=60\))**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{**\(p\)-value**} \\ \hline Duration of intervention before RP (days) (mean \(\pm\) Std) & \(52.0\pm 19.6\) & \(53.2\pm 37.4\) & \(0.82\) [FOOTNOTE:]Footnote : **In the case of a single-population participants did not change their diet during the course of our trial. The healthier diet in our study population may have decreased the power to detect a significant effect of MAG-EPA supplementation on tumor Ki-67 expression. The omega-6omega-3 ratio decreased to 2.2 after the MAG-EPA intervention, similar to the fish oil based intervention in the Aronson trial (ratio of 2.7). In the latter study, Ki-67 was expressed in 3.9% of prostate tumor cells for the fish oil intervention group compared to 6.2% in the western diet group. In our study, Ki-67 was expressed in 2.9% and 3.1% of prostate tumor cells in placebo and MAG-EPA groups, respectively. This suggests that increased Ki-67 expression could be more related to unhealthy LCa6 rich diet, rather than to a LCa3 intervention and that omega-6 fatty acids could drive Ki-67 increased expression.

Based on fatty acid profiling in prostate tissue, the absolute level of EPA fatty acid subtype was increased following the concentrated MAG-EPA intervention compared to placebo, but not DHA level. This confirms that the conversion of EPA into DHA in humans is very slow, especially in men tissues, as suggested previously[38]. According to previous results using fish oil-based intervention[32, 39], DHA fatty acid subtype could also be a more important modulator than EPA for the Ki-67 specific marker.

Biological effects of LCa3 are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by their anti-inflammatory properties. We profiled 27 circulating inflammatory mediators, and compared the changes of cytokine levels following 7 weeks of intervention. Only IL-7 was higher in MAG-EPA group compared to placebo, suggesting that MAG-EPA could enhance IL-7-driven immunity. IL-7 is known to play a role in both B and T cells' differentiation, development, and maturation during adaptive immunity. It was also shown to have antitumor activity by enhancing the proliferation and survival of T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment[6]. Indeed recent studies support a potential effect of systemic administration of IL-7 to improve immunotherapy response in prostate cancer[11, 12]. However, we cannot exclude that this only difference was due to multiple comparisons. The significant difference was also weaker in the _per protocol_ analysis, suggesting at best a modest effect of MAG-EPA on circulating IL-7.

How high EPA prostate tissue level may affect prostate cancer aggressiveness remains unclear. We previously showed that MAG-EPA treatment reduced cancer growth in the TRAMP-C2 syngenetic immune-competent mouse model associated with a significant downregulation of angiogenesis- and vascular-related pathways in the tumor, as well as significant decreased of tumor blood vessel diameter[7]. Prostate tumor blood vessel diameter was also significantly reduced in the first subset of ten MAG-EPA treated, compared to the first 10 placebo treated patients from the present study, but not in the adjacent normal tissue, suggesting that the anti-angiogenic effect is on the tumor-specific microenvironment[7]. Using the same TRAMP-C2 model, we observed a reduced tumor growth in mice fed with an LCa3 enriched diet compared to controls which was associated with an increase in tumor tissue levels of EPA and its derived metabolites, a reduction of pro-angiogenic prostaglandin E2 and increased levels of F4-neuroprostanes and resolvis suspected to have anti-inflammatory effects[8]. More recent data from a subset of patients of the present trial suggest a beneficial effect of MAG-EPA supplement on the gut microbiome[6].

Some limitations are worth mentioning. We did not stratify the randomization for cancer grade. The MAG-EPA group had more cases of higher-grade prostate cancer which increased the Ki-67 expression. Adjusted analyses controlled for this difference but residual confounding remains possible. Our study population had a favorable omega-6omega-3 dietary ratio to start with, as discussed above. It is possible that the MAG-EPA intervention could have reduced the Ki-67 index if performed in a population of prostate cancer patients with higher omega-6 and lower omega-3 intake, which presumably would have had a higher baseline prostate cancer proliferative rate.

In conclusion, pre-operative MAG-EPA dietary supplementation did not reduce cancer cell Ki-67 index. More studies are needed to better understand the biological and clinical outcomes following this concentrated
