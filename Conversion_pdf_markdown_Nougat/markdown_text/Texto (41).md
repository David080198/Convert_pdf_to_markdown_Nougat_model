 The mean pretreatment ages were 26 years (15.7-47.6 years) for the surgery subjects and 21.9 years (15.7-44.4 years) for the Herbst patients. Adulthood in the Herbst subjects was defined by the pretreatment hand-wrist radiographic skeletal maturity stages R-IJ (4 subjects) or R-J (19 subjects) according to Hagg and Taranger.[8] At the end of treatment, all Herbst subjects had reached the stage R-J. Although no skeletal maturity data existed for the surgery subjects, all were considered to have finished their growth.

The 46 surgery subjects were treated with mandibular advancement with a retromolar sagittal split osteotomy without genioplasty; 23 were treated at the Orthognathic Surgery Clinic in Malmo, Sweden, with a modification of the osteotomy according to Hunsuck[9] and Epker,[10] and the other 23 were treated at the Orthognathic Surgery Clinic in Minden, Germany, with a modification according to Obwegeser[11] and Dal Pont.[12] The Herbst patients were all treated at the Department of Orthodontics, University of Giessen, Germany, with a casted splint Herbst appliance.[13] Total treatment times averaged 1.7 years for the surgery subjects and 1.8 years for the Herbst subjects.

Lateral headfilms in habitual occlusion from before treatment and after all treatment (after multibracket appliance treatment after surgery and Herbst, respectively) were analyzed. Tracings of the radiographs were made, and linear and angular measurements were taken to the nearest 0.5 mm and 0.5\({}^{\circ}\), respectively. No correction was made for linear enlargement (approximately 8% in the median plane). To reduce the method error, all registrations of the 2 headfilms from each subject were done in the same session. Furthermore, all registrations were done twice with an interval of at least 2 weeks between the registrations. In the final evaluation, the mean value of the registrations was used.

In the surgery subjects, A-point was transferred from the first to the second radiograph after superimposing the headfilms on the stable structures of the anterior cranial base.[14] This procedure was considered valid because all subjects were nongrowing, the surgery was limited to the mandible, and no marked dental changes were expected in the maxilla. In the Herbst subjects, on the other hand, A-point was located on each lateral headfilm, because dental maxillary changes influencing A-point are known to occur.

Cephalometric changes of sagittal and vertical jaw-base relationship, incisor relationship, facial height, facial profile convexity, and lip position were assessed by using standard variables not described in detail. The cephalometric landmarks are shown in Figure 1.

The sagittal-occlusal analysis (SO analysis) of Pancherz[15] was used to analyze the sagittal occlusal changes during the observation period. For all recordings on the pretreatment and posttreatment radiographs, the occlusal line (OL) (defined by the incisal tip of the most protruded maxillary incisor and the distobuccal cusp of the first permanent maxillary molar) and the occlusal line perpendicular (OLp) through sella from the first headfilm were used as the reference grid. The grid was transferred from the pretreatment to the posttreatment radiograph after superimposing the radiographs on the stable bone structures of the anterior cranial base.[14] The SO analysis comprised the following linear variables (Fig 2):

1. Is/OLp minus li/OLp = overjet
2. Ms/OLp minus Mi/OLp = molar relationship (positive value indicates distal relationship; negative value indicates normal or mesial relationship)
3. A/OLp = position of the maxillary jaw base
4. Pg/OLp = position of the mandibular jaw base
5. Is/OLp = position of the maxillary central incisor
6. li/OLp = position of the mandibular central incisor
7. Ms/OLp, position of the maxillary permanent first molar
8. Mi/OLp = position of the mandibular permanent first molar

Changes in the different measuring points in relation to OLp during treatment were calculated as after-minus-before differences (D) in landmark position. Variables 3 and 4 describe skeletal changes, and variables 1, 2, and 5 through 8 represent a composite effect of skeletal and dental changes. Variables for dental changes in the maxilla and mandible were obtained by the following calculations (variables 9-12):

1. Is/OLp (D) minus A/OLp (D) = changes in position of the maxillary incisor
2. li/OLp (D) minus Pg/OLp (D) = changes in position of the mandibular incisor
3. Ms/OLp (D) minus A/OLp (D) = changes in the position of the maxillary permanent first molar
4. Mi/OLp (D) minus Pg/OLp (D) = changes in the position of the mandibular permanent first molar

An important measure of success and predictability for a certain treatment approach is the consistency of treatment changes. This consistency was calculated as the percentage of subjects exhibiting a certain treatment change larger than or equal to 0.5\({}^{\circ}\) or 0.5 mm, respectively.

### Statistical methods

For the different variables, the arithmetic mean (mean) and the standard deviation (SD) were calculated.

 Student \(t\) tests for unpaired samples were performed to assess possible differences between the 2 surgical approaches (Swedish and German samples) as well as between the surgery and Herbst groups. Student \(t\) tests for paired samples were performed to assess the significance of treatment changes in the surgery and Herbst groups. The statistical significance was determined at the 0.1%, 1%, and 5% levels of confidence. A level larger than 5% was considered statistically not significant.

The method error of the double registrations (tracings and measurements from before and after treatment roentgenograms) of all subjects was calculated by using the formula of Dahlberg:[16]

\[\mathrm{ME}=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{\Delta}d^{2}}{2n}}\]

where \(d\) is the difference between 2 measurements of a pair and \(n\) is the number of subjects. The maximum method error for dental changes was 1.0 mm. For skeletal and soft tissue changes, the method error did not exceed 0.7 mm for linear variables, 1.0\({}^{\circ}\) for angular variables, and 1.2 for index variables.

## 6 Results

Because of the small number of men in the surgery (n \(=8\)) and the Herbst (n \(=4\)) groups as well as the identical relative frequency (17%) of men in the 2 groups, sex differences were not considered. Thus, the male and females samples in each treatment group were pooled.

Because the comparison of the treatment effects of the 2 modifications of the retromolar sagittal split osteotomy (Hunsuck/Epker and Obwegeser/Dal Pont) showed no statistically significant differences, the 2 surgery samples were evaluated as 1 group.

The cephalometric records of the surgery and Herbst groups before and after treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2. With respect to the cephalometric standard variables (Table 1) from before treatment, the surgery group compared with the Herbst group had a larger Wits value (mean 2.2 mm; \(P<.01\)), a larger posterior facial height index (mean 5.5; \(P<.001\)), a smaller interjaw-base angle (mean 5.5; \(P<.01\)), and a larger soft tissue profile convexity including the nose (mean 4.9; \(P<.001\)). With respect to the variables of the SO analysis (Table 2) from before treatment, no statistically significant differences between the surgery and the Herbst groups were found.

 \(P<.001\); SNPg, mean 0.9\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.01\)) and consequently greater decreases in sagittal jaw-base relationship angles (ANB, mean 1.7\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\); SNPg, mean 1.3\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\)). The Wits appraisal showed a larger reduction in the surgery than in the Herbst group (Wits mean, 3.0\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\)).

The amount of overbite reduction was comparable for the surgery and Herbst subjects. The mandibular

Table plane angle showed opposite changes in the 2 treatment groups. In the surgery group, the ML/NSL increased (mean 3.3\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\)), whereas a decrease (mean 0.7\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.05\)) was noted in the Herbst group. The interjaw-base angle (ML/NL) increased in the surgery group (mean 3.7\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\)) and decreased in the Herbst group (mean 0.1\({}^{\circ}\), not significant). The inclination of the maxilla in relation to the anterior cranial base (NL/NSL) was unaffected by either surgery or Herbst treatment.

Anterior facial height increased more in the surgery group than in the Herbst group (index mean 0.8, \(P<.001\)). Similar to the changes of the mandibular plane angle, the posterior facial height showed opposite changes in the 2 groups. A reduction in posterior facial height took place in the surgery group (index mean 2.0, \(P<.001\)), whereas an increase was seen in the Herbst group (index mean 1.0; \(P<.01\)).

The amount of profile convexity reduction was larger in the surgery group than in the Herbst group. The largest group difference (mean 3.4\({}^{\circ}\)) was found for skeletal profile convexity (NAPg, mean 3.4\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.001\)) and the smallest for soft tissue profile convexity including the nose (NS/No/PgS, mean 2.2\({}^{\circ}\), \(P<.01\)).

The positions of the upper and lower lips became more retrusive in both treatment groups. A statistically significant group difference was found only for the upper lip (UL-E-line), which became more retusive (1.2 mm, \(P<.01\)) in the surgery group.

### SO analysis treatment changes

The treatment changes in the surgery and Herbst groups are shown in Table 4. The amounts of overjet reduction (surgery, 6.3 mm; Herbst, 6.7 mm), Class II molar correction (surgery, 5.0 mm; Herbst, 4.1 mm), and mandibular molar mesialization (surgery, 1.6 mm, Herbst, 1.4 mm) were comparable in the 2 groups. The surgery group had greater (mean 2.8 mm, \(P<.001\)) mandibular advancement than the Herbst group. In comparison with the surgery group, the Herbst group showed greater maxillary base forward development (mean 0.4 mm; \(P<.001\)), maxillary incisor retrusion (mean 1.8 mm, \(P<.01\)), and mandibular incisor protrusion (mean 1.8 mm; \(P<.01\)). The maxillary molars moved in opposite directions in the 2 groups. A mesial movement of the maxillary molars was found in the surgery group (mean 0.7 mm, \(P<.05\)), and a distal movement was seen in the Herbst group (mean 1.8 mm, \(P<.001\)).

Table 3: Standard cephalometrics. Comparison of treatment changes (mean, SD) in 46 adult Class II Division 1 subjects treated with orthognathic surgery (mandibular sagittal split osteotomy) followed by multibracket appliance and 23 adult Class II Division 1 subjects treated with Herbst appliance followed by multibracket appliance changes contributing to Class II correction in the incisor and molar regions is shown in Figure 3. In the Herbst group, the improvement in sagittal occlusion was achieved by dental more than skeletal changes; in the surgery group, the opposite was the case. The amount of skeletal changes contributing to overjet and molar correction was larger in the surgery (63% and 80%, respectively) than in the Herbst (13% and 22%, respectively) group.

### Individual changes

The individual changes for 8 of the 25 analyzed cephalometric variables are given in Figure 4. All variables had substantial interindividual variation in both the groups.

The maximum amounts of changes in individual subjects of the 2 groups are given in Table 5. The largest amount of overjet reduction was in a Herbst subject (12.2 mm). For all other variables, the maximum amount of individual changes was noted in the surgery subjects. Even if the amount of changes differed between the groups, the direction of changes was the same, except for the mandibular plane angle and posterior facial height.

The consistency of treatment reaction is given in Table 5. Overjet and overbite were reduced consistently in both the surgery (98% for both variables) and the Herbst (100% and 96%, respectively) subjects; 100% of the Herbst and 93% of the surgery subjects had improved molar relationships. Mandibular pragthism increased more consistently in the surgery (SNB \(=91\%\)) than in the Herbst (SNB \(=74\%\)) subjects. Correspondingly, more patients with an ANB reduction were seen in the surgery than in the Herbst (98% and 74%, respectively) groups. The vertical jaw-base relationship and the anterior and posterior facial heights were more consistently affected by surgery (91% increase, 87% increase, and 78% decrease, respectively) than by Herbst treatment (56% decrease, 52% increase, and 65% increase, respectively). Skeletal profile convexity and soft tissue profile convexity including and excluding the nose were reduced more consistently in the surgery (91%, 96%, and 76%, respectively) than in the Herbst (70%, 96%, and 83%, respectively) subjects.

The skeletonical changes during treatment are shown for 2 surgery subjects (Figs 5 and 6) and 2 Herbst subjects (Figs 7 and 8).

Table 4: SO-Analysis. Comparison of treatment changes (mean, SD) in 46 adult Class II Division 1 subjects treated with orthognathic surgery (mandibular sagittal split osteotomy) followed by multibracket appliance and 23 adult Class II Division 1 subjects treated with Herbst appliance followed by multibracket appliance with severe open bite) treated during 10 years. The Herbst sample comprised consecutive Class II Division 1 adults treated with the Herbst appliance at the orthodontic department in Giessen.

There was a clear overrepresentation of women in both samples. This agrees with earlier studies of adult orthodontic and orthognathic surgery patients [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. The reason for this unequal sex distribution is unknown, but it might be associated with women's greater interest in improving their facial and dental appearance [22].

For the pretreatment cephalometric parameters, the surgery group had a significantly larger posterior facial height and a smaller interjaw-base angle. Thus, considering the vertical jaw-base relationship, the surgery subjects had slightly better pretreatment conditions for Class II correction than did the Herbst subjects [23, 24]. On the other hand, the Wits appraisal and the soft tissue profile convexity including the nose were significantly larger in the surgery group. Therefore, from the sagittal discrepancy point of view, the surgery group had slightly more severe pretreatment conditions.

All subjects in both groups were treated successfully to a Class I occlusal relationship. The amount of overjet reduction was greatest in the Herbst subjects. This was true when comparing group averages and looking at the maximum individual overjet reduction. Proffit et al [25] stated that orthodontic treatment was likely to fail (even in adolescents when growth assists Class II correction) if the overjet exceeds 10 mm. In our Herbst sample, however, larger overjet reductions (maximum reduction, 12.2 mm) were found. Average overbite reduction also was larger in the Herbst than in the surgery group, whereas Class II molar correction was, on average, slightly more pronounced in the surgery group.

Even though Class II correction was very successful in the Herbst patients, the mechanism behind it was different from that in the patients treated with orthog

 nathic surgery. Both the standard cephalometric records and the SO analysis showed that the Class II malocclusions in the Herbst subjects were corrected by dental more than skeletal changes; in the surgery subjects, the opposite was the case. This finding agrees with previous studies comparing the treatment effects of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery in adults.[17, 21]

The most profound difference between the surgery

 and the Herbst subjects was the greater mandibular base advancement (SNB, SNPg, Pg/OLp), resulting in larger reductions of the ANB angle, the Wits appraisal, and the skeletal and soft tissue profile convexities in the surgery group. The greater upper lip retrusion in the surgery group was most likely due to the larger mandibular base advancement in those subjects. As a result of the mandibular advancement, the reference line (esthetic line) automatically became more anteriorly positioned, thus resulting in a relative lip retrusion.

Other marked differences between the 2 treatment groups were the direction in changes of the mandibular plane angle and posterior facial height. Although a larger increase in posterior facial height than in anterior facial height (resulting in a reduction in the mandibular plane angle) was noted in the Herbst group, the opposite was true in the surgery group. Because the pretreatment mandibular plane angle of the surgery group was normal [26], the increase in the angle must be considered unfavorable in Class II treatment. The angular increase in the surgery subjects was most probably due to bone remodeling in the gonion area. This remodeling has been shown to continue long after surgery [20, 27]. Possible causes are an inadequate overlap between the 2 bony fragments at the time of surgery [28, 29], the partial detachment of the elevator muscles from the gonion area (operation according to Obwegeser/Dal Pont only) and their subsequent reattachment and adaptation [27], the

 general postsurgical adaptive processes of all soft tissues, tendons, and muscles that have been directly or indirectly affected by the surgical jaw displacement [27, 30, 31], and the possible condylar resorption that has been reported rather frequently in orthognathic surgery patients [17, 27], especially in those with a pretreatment internal derangement of the TMJ [32].

The direction of maxillary molar movements differed between the 2 treatment groups. Although the distal movement of the maxillary molar in the Herbst group was to be expected from the headgear effect of the appliance [33], the mesial movement of the maxillary molars in the surgery group was unexpected because all subjects were treated nonextraction. Even if decreases in maxillary and mandibular arch lengths in adulthood occur [34], the amounts of change in the surgery subjects were larger than those normally reported to occur over 1 decade. A possible explanation for the mesial movement of the maxillary molars is a transverse maxillary expansion most likely performed in most of the patients during the presurgical orthodontic phase. The space gained by this expansion might have been reciprocally closed, leading to the observed extrusion of the maxillary incisors (1.4 mm) and the mesial movement of the maxillary molars (0.7 mm).

The consistency in treatment reaction was larger for the surgery group than for the Herbst group for variables directly or indirectly affected by the amount of mandibular advancement (SNB, ANB, skeletal profile convexity). On the other hand, the reduction in soft tissue profile convexity excluding the nose was the same (96%) in both groups, whereas, for the reduction of the soft tissue profile convexity including the nose, the consistency was larger in the Herbst subjects. Furthermore, for the Class II corrective variables (overljet, overbite, molar relationship), no marked group differences were detected. Therefore, the predictability of the treatment outcome in terms of consistency of changes was, on average, comparable for both groups. This agrees with the findings of Tulloch et al [35], who concluded that the success rate of overjet reduction was only slightly higher for orthodontic than for surgical treatment irrespective of age and malocclusion severity.

Thus, the question arises which is the best treatment modality for a borderline Class II adult. Even when the knowledge from this study is added to what is known from the literature, there seems to be no single, conclusive answer to the question. Several factors must be considered in the treatment decision process: (1) the reason the patient is seeking treatment; (2) the effects that can be provided by Herbst treatment and orthongathic surgery, respectively; and (3) the costs and risks of the 2 treatment approaches.

There is agreement in the literature that the main reasons for adults seeking treatment are dental and facial esthetics as well as stomatognathic or functional improvement [36, 37, 38]. Patients with severe skeletal Class II malocclusions are more motivated to undergo orthodontic than surgical treatment [38]. This is not surprising because most people prefer the least invasive measure to solve their problems. Interestingly, the type of treatment selected (surgery or orthodontics) depends mainly on the subject's self-perception of his or her facial profile and is not associated with the degree of dentoskeletal discrepancy. This means that the more dissatisfied the patients are with their facial esthetics, the more likely they are to choose surgery [39, 40]. However, after treatment, surgical and orthodontic patients were equally satisfied with their profile changes [17, 20].

In our study, larger reductions in profile convexity were found in the surgery group than in the Herbst group. In contrast, Shell and Woods [41] found that,

Figure 7: **A**, Pretreatment and **B**, posttreatment lateral headfilms of 19-year-old female Herbst subject.

 regardless of whether Class II patients were treated with growth modification during adolescence or orthognathic surgery during adulthood, facial esthetics improved to a similar extent. Furthermore, the reduction in facial profile convexity achieved by Herbst treatment seems not to be age-dependent.[4]

Even if the occlusion can be corrected very successfully by adult Herbst treatment, chin projection and thus facial esthetics might be not be optimal after therapy. If, however, chin prominence is the main problem for the patient, advancement genioplasty offers a less costly, less risky alternative to enhance facial esthetics than a mandibular sagittal split osteotomy.[42, 43]

Even though stomatognathic or functional improvement is the second most frequent reason for adults to seek treatment, little is known about the changes in masticatory function after orthognathic surgery. For Class III patients, scientific data show no significant improvement in postoperative masticatory function.[44] For Class II patients, on the other hand, at least to our knowledge, no such data exist.

Although there is controversy about the effect of orthognathic surgery on TMJ function, recent data[45] seem to support the view that patients with preexisting articular disc displacements undergoing mandibular advancement surgery are likely to have a significant worsening of the TMJ dysfunction problem postsurgery. No comparable data exist for adult Herbst treatment. However, in a group of Herbst subjects that included 8 of the present adults, TMJ function was found to improve during treatment.[46]

When looking at the costs of combined orthodontic-orthognathic surgery treatment, 60%-75% are due to the surgical part.[47, 48, 49] Therefore, a remarkable cost reduction in adult Class II treatment can be achieved with the Herbst appliance instead of orthognathic surgery.

The most common surgical risk of mandibular advancement is neurosensory disturbances of the lower lip that affect about 50% of the subjects.[50] Additionally, nonunion or mal-union of the bony fragments, bad splits,[51] and condylar resorption[17, 32] are frequent complications. Even if neurosensory disturbances of the lip occur after genioplasty alone, the prevalence is significantly lower than with mandibular sagittal split or a combination of sagittal split and genioplasty.[52]

A main complication in orthodontics is root resorption. The amount of root resorption has been found to correlate with the amount of overjet reduction and horizontal tooth movement.[53] Furthermore, extensive palatal root torque, which is likely to be applied during orthodontic Class II treatment, has been shown to be a predisposing factor for root resorption of the mandibular incisors.[54] Thus, when comparing surgery and dentofacial orthopedics (Herbst appliance), the risks associated with surgery are obviously much greater. Finally, the failure rate of surgical Class II treatment is higher than that for a dentofacial orthopedic/orthodontic approach.[35] Therefore, the important question in treatment planning is whether the greater improvement in facial esthetics accomplished by orthognathic surgery compared with dentofacial orthopedics with the Herbst appliance is worth the increased costs and risks of the surgical approach.

## Conclusions

The Herbst appliance is a powerful tool for nonsurgical, nonextraction treatment of adult Class II malocclusions. Thus, the treatment approach can be considered as an alternative to orthognathic surgery in borderline skeletal Class II subjects. For Class II correction, the success rate and predictability of Herbst treatment is as high as for orthognathic surgery. If, however, the patient's main wish is a greatly improved facial profile, orthognathic surgery is the better treatment alternative.
