[Summary]Background: Temporal trends in the incidence of pediatric-onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are controversial and a wide range of estimates have been reported worldwide. We conducted a systematic review of research describing the epidemiology of childhood-onset IBD to assess changes in incidence rates over time and to evaluate international differences.

Inflammary bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,greater total number of susceptibility genes and/or to earlier exposure to environmental triggers.

There has yet to be a comprehensive review of trends of the epidemiology of pediatric-onset IBD. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to describe worldwide rates of pediatric IBD and specifically examined trends in the incidence of childhood-onset disease in order to summarize the literature, highlighting similarities and differences by geographic region. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to generate hypotheses that will inspire future research to investigate the etiology, environmental factors, and geographic differences of pediatric-onset IBD.

## 11 Materials and Methods

### Search Strategy and Study Selection

We conducted an electronic search of the online bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialised Trial Register to identify potentially relevant studies published in print or online before January 1, 2010. Our detailed search strategy is outlined in Table 1.

Studies reporting incidence and/or prevalence of IBD, CD, and/or UC were included. All included articles were required to meet the following four criteria. First, they must have reported the methods used to obtain the diagnosis, such as (but not limited to) clinical characteristics, historical findings, histology, radiologic findings, or (in the case of health administrative databases) physician diagnosis. Second, if incidence was reported, studies were required to follow patients with IBD forward from diagnosis (inception cohort). Third, included studies must have provided population-based prevalence/incidence estimates of patients \(<\)21 years old, with a denominator for total population estimate of the relevant age groups. Lastly, the study must have been published in full manuscript form. Study exclusion criteria included review articles or meta-analyses, studies that based their incidence estimates on fewer than five pediatric cases of IBD, CD, or UC, and studies that reported left-sided colitis or proctitis rates only, without reporting incidence or prevalence of total UC cases. The reference lists of review articles were searched for studies meeting inclusion criteria.

Abstracts of all articles meeting the above search strategy were screened for eligibility. Full-text studies were retrieved if they were potentially eligible for inclusion or if they were relevant review articles (for a manual reference search). The retrieved full-text articles were then independently reviewed by E.I.B. and K.J.F. for eligibility, and the decision to include or exclude was by consensus. Any disagreement was solved by consultation with the content expert (A.M.G.).

### Data Extraction

Two authors (E.I.B. and K.J.F.) independently completed a data extraction form for each eligible study. Forms were then reviewed to assure consistency of data extraction. A third author (J.V.L.) aided with article language translation. Disagreement was solved after review of the article by the content expert (A.M.G.). All data extracted from the studies were entered into Access 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA).

### Summarization of Data

Description of the studies were summarized using proportions. Geographic maps of incidence (from studies reporting incidence after 1990) of IBD, CD, and UC were created using ArcGIS v. 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA). Choropleth (shaded) maps used here represent rate values using color intensity (darker color indicates higher rate). The value ranges shown on maps were derived using Jenk's natural breaks classification method[6] and rounded to the nearest decimal value. Rate values in local jurisdictions are shown only for Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA). For other countries where rates existed for local jurisdictions, the highest rate value within the given country was assigned to all of the country's jurisdictions where rates were not reported and then mapped. This ensured that incidence for these countries will be visible despite the fact that the jurisdictions with reported rates may occupy a small geographic region of the country. Incidence reported by studies at multiple timepoints were plotted onto line graphs for both CD and UC using Excel 2007 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA), with rates plotted representing either raw or age- and sex-adjusted incidence per 100,000 population. Where incidence was reported for a multiyear time period, this was plotted as the incidence in the final year of that time period.

## Results

### Search Results

A total of 2209 references were reviewed, resulting in 139 included studies [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 48, 49, 51, 53, 65, 66, 71, 72, 77, 79, 83, 84, 86, 92, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 116, 117, 124, 129, 134, 136, 137, 141, 145] from 32 to 18.5%. Of included articles, 39 (28.1%) reported IBD incidence and/or prevalence in children only [8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 29, 31, 48, 49, 51, 53, 65, 68, 71, 72, 77, 79, 83, 84, 86, 92, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 124, 129, 134, 136, 137, 141, 145], while the remaining 100 (71.9%) reported rates of pediatric IBD within cohorts of children and adults. The methods used for case ascertainment varied significantly between studies. Of included studies, 104 (74.8%) used one method of case ascertainment, 29 studies (20.9%) used two methods of case ascertainment, and six studies (4.3%) used three methods of case ascertainment. These consisted of retrospective chart review (\(n=62\)), active prospective surveillance, including disease registries (\(n=62\)), health administrative data or large epidemiologic databases (\(n=33\)), surveys of practitioners or patients (\(n=16\)), and other methods such as birth/death registries and laboratory/pathology databases (\(n=7\)). Figure 2 shows incidence rates by jurisdiction for studies reporting incidence after 1990. Table 2 summarizes included studies.

### Temporal Trends in Incidence

Of included articles, 28 (20.1%) used statistical analysis to assess trends over time in incidence of pediatric-onset CD, UC, or both. The most common statistical test used was Poisson regression analysis (\(n=11\)). In the case of five studies, \(P\)-values were quoted; however, the study methods reported no details of the statistical test used to obtain these results. Of nine articles which tested statistical trends in pediatric IBD overall, seven (77.8%) reported increased incidence over time and no study reported decreased incidence. Of 25 studies that calculated temporal trends in CD incidence, 15 (60.0%) reported significant

increases, one (4.0%) reported decreased incidence, and nine (36.0%) reported no significant change. Of 20 studies calculating temporal trends in UC incidence, four (20.0%) reported significant increases, 13 (65.0%) reported no significant change, and three (15.0%) reported significantly decreased incidence. Figure 3 shows incidence rates over time for studies with incidence measurements in multiple time periods, whether or not authors calculated statistical trends over time.

Three studies reported statistically significant increases in incidence rates by age group. A study using health administrative data from Ontario, Canada reported significant increases in IBD incidence for 6-month to 4-year-old (5.0% per year, \(P\) = 0.03) and 5-9-year-old patients (7.6% per year, \(P\) < 0.0001), and CD incidence for patients aged 5-9 years old (8.7% per year, \(P\) < 0.0001).[18] By contrast, a recent report from Texas demonstrated significantly increased incidence of IBD in children

 aged 10-14 and 15-17 with stable incidence in children under 10.[92] Another study reported significant increases in the UK from 1981-1995 of CD and UC patients aged 12-16 years (males with CD: from 4.7-7.4 per 100,000, males with UC: from 1.8-3.8 per 100,000, females with CD: from 3.4-6.0 per 100,000, females with UC: from 0.9-3.6 per 100,000) and females aged 7-11 years (for CD: from 1.2-2.8 per 100,000 population, for UC: from 1.2-2.4 per 100,000).[13] No regression estimates or \(P\)-values were reported in that study.

## 7 Discussion

This study examined the worldwide epidemiology of childhood-onset IBD. Comprehensive computer databases have made it possible to report trends in incidence of IBD, CD, and UC around the world using large disease registries, medical records, nationwide birth cohorts, or health administrative databases. Overall, the results of this systematic review suggest that the incidence of IBD is rising internationally. More specifically, the incidence of CD has risen significantly in several countries, while most studies have reported stable incidence of pediatric-onset UC. However, these trends are not described uniformly around the world and most countries lack accurate estimates of incidence and prevalence of pediatric IBD. In particular, there is a paucity of information on rates of pediatric IBD from developing nations in Asia, Africa, and South America. Description of epidemiologic trends from these regions may help investigators understand the effect of migration from underdeveloped to developed nations on the risk of IBD development. For example, the increased risk of IBD development in patients of South Asian origin upon their emigration to Canada and the UK has been reported,[146, 147, 148] raising the possibility that environmental factors interact with their genetic background to trigger this higher risk. The worldwide comparison of incidence risk in migrants may help elucidate these environmental triggers.

Twin studies have shown that inherited genetic risk factors alone play a small role in the pathogenesis of IBD (16%-36% concordance rates in monozygotic twins and 4% concordance rates in difygotic twins), and thereby point to strong environmental influences.[149] Western lifestyle has been identified as a potential culprit in the evolution of IBD[150]; however, the environmental triggers of IBD have not been well delineated. The "cold chain hypothesis" suggests that refrigeration has altered the bacterial content of our diet, resulting in the increased growth of disease-triggering organisms.[151] As with atopic diseases, the "hygiene hypothesis" suggests that a cleaner environment, smaller families, and lower exposure to farm animals has resulted in increased risk of IBD in Westerinized nations.[152, 153] Nevertheless, individually identified triggers have been controversial and an explanation of differing trends in CD and UC remains elusive.[150] Recent research suggests that vitamin D is an inducer of NOD2 function, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in disease development.[154] Vitamin D deficiency may explain the higher incidence of CD described in northern regions of some countries.[14, 100] We were unable to confirm the north-south gradient in pediatric IBD based on our review. Despite higher rates of CD reported in Canada, Norway, and Sweden, research from southern European regions such as Corsica, Spain (Astruias), and Croatia has demonstrated a relatively higher incidence than countries of higher latitude in Europe such as Finland and northern France.

This discrepancy may be due to heterogeneity of data collection techniques, differences in disease classification, differences in the age limit used for pediatric patients, or referral bias, making it difficult to compare studies included in our systematic review. For example, some studies used hospital records while others used surveys and administrative data. However, several included studies reported rates across time and thus may more accurately represent the true trend in incidence of pediatric IBD. Of those calculating statistical trends, most examining CD demonstrated significantly increased incidence, while most examining UC demonstrated no statistically significant change. Similarly, when studies assessing incidence over time (but without statistical trend analysis) were plotted, a more consistent rise in CD incidence was demonstrated. UC incidence trends were not consistently rising (Fig. 3). These findings imply a worldwide increase in childhood-onset CD, but not UC. This is consistent with a systematic review of the epidemiology of CD in North America, which found increased incidence in adult-onset CD.[155]

This study not only functions to describe the incidence rates of pediatric IBD around the world, but also to highlight some of the key issues that limit the collection and analysis of IBD epidemiology data. As previously mentioned, it is difficult to compare across studies due to heterogeneity in data collection methods. This limitation is evident in studies from the same country that report vastly different estimates of incidence. Furthermore, the incidence rates reported for a specific country are often generalizations from regions within those countries. Some studies reported regional variation in rates of IBD using consistent methodologies, implying that different regions within a country may have different incidence rates. The relative rarity of pediatric IBD in most of the world prevents small area regional variation analysis of trends, and studies reporting incidence rarely describe health services factors that may have led to higher identification rates in some regions. Classification of CD and UC (particularly in nonprospectively collected data) may be subject to misclassification bias. Finally, the statistical tests used for analysis of trends varied across studies, with some reporting age- and sex-adjusted incidence while others analyzed crude rates. This heterogeneity limits both the internal and external validity of studies as well as the applicability of findings to other regions.

This study was limited to published articles and some abstracts or government reports containing valuable information may have been excluded as a result. We felt that due to the unique difficulties in gathering accurate data it was important to include only peer-reviewed, published articles in an attempt to ensure quality. Additionally, the previously described weaknesses of the included studies may have resulted in incorrect conclusions in our assessment of incidence trends. We chose to include all studies describing the epidemiology of pediatric IBD, without quality assessment as an exclusion criterion, in order to provide the most comprehensive review of international incidence trends in the literature. Despite these limitations, we believe that this study addresses some of the key concerns in collecting and reporting of epidemiologic data and future researchers should strive for rigorous methods to improve the accuracy of their estimates.

The incidence of pediatric-onset IBD (and CD in particular) seems to be increasing for uncertain reasons. This increase has been demonstrated both in Western regions such as Canada, France, and northern Europe and in former eastern European bloc countries such as the Czech Republic, Croatia, and Hungary. Understanding the changes in trends of pediatric IBD is crucial to unraveling its etiology. Further research is required to investigate and compare trends between developing and developed countries to gain more insight regarding possible environmental factors associated with IBD. As well, key information about interactions between genetics and environment can be studied by examining the effect of migration. By describing the international rates of childhood-onset IBD, we hope to stimulate research that may eventually lead to a more comprehensive theory about the etiology and risk factors for the development of pediatric IBD.
