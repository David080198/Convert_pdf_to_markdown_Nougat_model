###### Abstract

**Background** Natural cytokines are poorly suited as therapeutics for systemic administration due to suboptimal pharmacological and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Recombinant human interleukin-2 (HL-2) has shown promise for treatment of autoimmune (AI) disorders yet exhibits short systemic half-life and opposing immune responses that negate an appropriate therapeutic index.

**Methods** A semi-synthetic microbial technology platform was used to engineer a site-specifically regulated form of rhll-2 with enhanced PK, specificity for induction of immune-suppressive regulatory CD4 + T cells (Tregs), and reduced stimulation of off-target effector T and NK cells. A library of rhll-2 molecules was constructed with single site-specific, biorthogonal chemistry-compatible non-canonical amino acids installed near the interface where IL-2 engages its cognate receptor \(\beta_{\text{T}}\) (IL-2R\(\beta_{\text{T}}\)) signaling complex. Biorthogonal site-specific pegylation and functional screening identified variants that retained engagement of the IL-2R chain with attenuated potency at the IL-2R\(\beta_{\text{T}}\) complex.

**Results** Phenotypic screening in mouse identifies SAR444336 (SAR44336; formerly known as THOR-809), rhll-2 pegylated at H16, as a potential development candidate that specifically expands peripheral CD4 + Tregs with upregulation of markers that correlate with their suppressive function including FoxP3, ICOS and Helios, yet minimally expands CD8 + T or NK cells. In non-human primate, administration of SAR'336 also induces dose-dependent expansion of Tregs and upregulated suppressive markers without significant expansion of CD8 + T or NK cells. SAR'336 administration reduces inflammation in a delayed-type hypersensitivity mouse model, potently suppressing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation.

**Conclusion** SAR'336 is a specific Treg activator, supporting its further development for the treatment of Alu diseases.

Immun homeostasis requires a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and suppressive immune responses, and imbalances often result in immunologic disease. Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis by restricting the activity of self-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, with their distinction associated with multiple autoimmune (AI) and inflammatory-related conditions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 52, 59, 70, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 99, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 19, 12, 14, 19, 15, 17, 19, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,responses in an investigational strategy aimed at resetting immune tolerance [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 8 

### Generation of expression strains

To generate the azide-containing nAA, N6- (2-azidoethoxy)-carbonyl-L-lysine (AzK)-substituted IL-2 expression strains, an overnight culture of the parental strain SYTX169 was inoculated into 2xYT media containing 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 5 ug/mL tetracycline, and 50 mM potassium phosphate. The next day the culture was diluted and grown until an optical density of 0.4. The cells were then chilled on ice and centrifuged at 3000 x \(g\) for 10 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The resulting cell pellet was washed twice using an equal volume of pre-chilled sterile deionized water and centrifuged. After the second wash, the cells were resuspended in fresh pre-chilled sterile deionized water and transformed via electroporation. After electroporation, pre-warmed 2xYTP with 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol was added to the electroporated cells and rescued at a final concentration of 150 uM dNaMTP and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C shaking at 250 rpm for an hour and inoculated into 2xYTP containing 5 ug/mL tetracycline, 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 50 ug/mL zeocin, 150 uM dNaMTP, and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP.

### Preparation of pegylated IL-2 variants

Expression of IL-2 variants with AzK substitutions was performed in 2xYT medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. BP9736) supplemented with 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 ug/mL ampicillin, 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 50 ug/mL Zecoin, 150 uM dNaMTP, and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP. Expression cultures were incubated overnight at 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and diluted prior to reaching OD600nm of 1 before dilution in the same medium back to OD600nm of 0.05. Upon reaching OD600nm of \(\sim\)0.8, cultures were pre-induced with 250 uM NaMTP, 25 uM TP3TP, and 10 mM AzK-HCl prepared in deionized water (Synchron, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA; Cat No. 36462). Approximately 15 min after pre-induction, cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG and incubated for an additional 5 h. Cultures were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and pellets were stored at \(-\)80 \({}^{\circ}\)C until use.

Inclusion bodies were generated by addition of 50 mL lysis buffer (1x PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. BP2940-4) containing protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. A32965) and 1x lysozyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 89833). Resuspended pellets were lysed via microfluidizer (Dyrhydrodymatics, model M110L). Lysed samples were centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 25 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C before discarding the supernatant. Inclusion body pellets were solubilized by addition of 25 mL 6 M Guanidine-HCl in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 20 mM imidazole per liter, pipetting until homogeneity before agitation for 15 min on a rotator. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 x \(g\) for 20 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C, and pellets were discarded.

Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 25216) was pre-washed with solubilization/wash buffer (6 M Guanidine HCI, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM imidazole). Equilibrated resin was added to solubilized sample in conical tubes and incubated 1 h at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C on a rotator. Resin was collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 250 x g, and washed with 10-15 column volumes of solubilization/wash buffer, transferred to a collection column and washed for an additional 10 column volumes of solubilization/wash buffer. The column was eluted using 3 column volumes of elution buffer (1x solubilization/wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole). Eluates were dialymed overnight in 12 l. of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8/150 mM NaCl, then moved to12 l. of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8/50 mM NaCl for an additional 4 h. The resulting dialysate was centrifuged at 30,000 x \(g\) for 20 min at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C and supernatant was collected.

Samples were supplemented with 0.5 uI enterokinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, Cat. No. BP070I) per 10 ug of protein and incubated overnight at room temperature. To initiate pepylation, 5 mM DBCO-mPEG (Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ; 30 kDa Cat. No. A121, 10 kDa: Cat. No. A119, or 5 kDa: Cat. No. A118) stock was added to a final concentration of 50 uM, and incubated overnight at 4 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Samples were concentrated using an Amicon-15 before loading onto HLiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA\({}^{\circ}\) Pure system (GE Healthcare) in 1x PBS. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot using rabbit anti-IL-2 oligodend antibody (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 710146). Peak fractions were pooled and adjusted to a final concentration of 4.5% acetonitrile, 0.043% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were loaded onto a reversed phase chromatography column (GE Healthcare) in 4.5% acetonitrile/0.043% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using a gradient of buffer B (90% acetonitrile/0.028% trifluoroacetic acid). Fractions of interest were pooled and mixed 1:1 with deionized H20, and lyophilized using a Laboconc Free/204.5 Lyophilized samples were then resuspended in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% FFA and quantitated using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve using biconthonic acid (BCA) method to determine final concentration prior to final lyophilization as above. Samples were stored lyophilized at \(-\)80 \({}^{\circ}\)C until use. Preparation of non-pegylated IL-2 and muteins was performed as above without pegylation steps described.

### Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)

The SPR studies described herein were performed under contract by Biosensor Tools LLC (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). The molecular mass of IL-2 samples was assumed to be 15 \({}^{\circ}\)5 kDa, plus additional size of 30 kDa or 50 kDa PEG conjugation. 50-9 g samples were dissolved in 50 uI. water to make stock solutions of 64.5 uM. The Fc-tagged human IL-2 receptor subunits (extracellular domains) were purchased from Sino Biological (hIL-2 Ra-Fc Sino 10165-H02H, hIL-2 Rg-Fc Sino 10696-H02H). Recombinant human IL-2 (hill-2) was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Cat. No. PHC0021) and prepared at a stock concentration of 64.5 uM.

Using a Biacore 4000 optical biosensor, the Fc-IL-2 receptor subunits were immobilized to a protein A-coated C1 sensor chip to densities of \(\sim\)300-800 RU and equilibrated with running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween-20, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4). For additional higher density surface studies for human and compounds 8 per receptors, the receptors were captured to \(\sim\)8000 and \(\sim\)13,000 RU, respectively. Binding studies were performed at 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C. When necessary, the protein A surfaces were regenerated with 150 mM phosphoric acid between binding cycles. The test articles were tested in duplicate, in twofold dilution series from 0.7 to 200 nM. The responses from IL-2R surfaces were fit to a 1:1 interaction model to obtain binding parameters using Scrubber (v2.0c).

### Flow cytometry assay for pSTATS induction

Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) studies using flow cytometry were performed under contract by PrimityBio (Fremont, California, USA) or internally. The collection of blood samples from healthy donors was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Scripps Research Institute (#177065). Leukocyte reduction systems (LRS) were purchased from Cell IDX (San Diego, California, USA). All donors provided informed consent. The studies were performed following the guidelines of the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki.

Whole blood samples were treated with compound and analyzed for pSTATS expression as previously described". Briefly, blood samples were pre-warmed to 37 \({}^{\circ}\)C, treated with a serial dilution of compound for 45 min, then red blood cells were lysed, and the leukocytes were stained with a panel of markers. Tregs are defined as CD3 \(+\) CD4\(+\) CD12ToD25\(+\) and CD8 T cells are CD3\(+\)CD8\(+\).

### Quantitative analysis of IL-2 by ELISA

Bioanalysis of plasma samples was performed using a human IL-2 ELISA assay (Abcam, Cat. No. 10056). Concentrations of SAR336 in plasma and the internal standard were determined using the ELISA assay. Pharmacokine (PK) data analysis was performed at NW Solutions (Seattle, Washington, USA).

### Animal models

Purpose-bred cynomolgus monkeys (_Macaca fascicularis_) were sourced from licensed vendors and underwent standard quarantine periods prior to study initiation. Animal studies were conducted in AAAALAC-accredited facilities at Charles River Laboratories (Reno, NV) under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Two- to four-year-old male cynomolgus monkeys weighing 2-3 kg were used.

All animals and data points were included in the analysis, except in cases of poor sample quality such as dotted blood. Sample sizes were not statistically pre-determined. Single-dose PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies utilized \(n=3\)-\(4\) animals per group. Repeat dosing studies or studies dosing with antigen utilized \(n=4\)-\(10\) animals per group due to larger expected variability. In total, \(265\) mice and \(48\) monkeys were used. Samples/ animals in all experiments were randomized to each group. Animals were allocated to study groups at random by the vendor or assigned associate and did not control for confounders such as order of treatments. Studies included serial collections or individual animals per time point. Most studies report quantitative data measured without subjective scoring the exception was a qualitative blinded analysis by a pathologist to score ear inflammation. Vendors, investigators, and data analysts were not blinded during experiments.

### Blood and tissue collection and processing for PK and immune cell profiling

C57BL6 mice were housed at \(72\pm 5\) "F, ambient humidity, and \(12\) h lightdark cycle. Animal welfare for this study compiled with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR Parts 1, 2 and 3) as applicable. All experimental data management and reporting procedures were in strict accordance with applicable Crown Bioscience, Inc or HD Biosciences Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures.

After a single intravenous injection of mice with H16, terminal blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture following CO\({}_{2}\) euthanasia. For the study of naive mice, blood was collected at \(13\) time points (\(0.03\), \(0.17\), \(0.5\), \(1.2\), \(4\), \(8\), \(1.2\), \(24\), \(48\), \(72\), \(96\), and \(120\) h) post-dose, sacrificing \(3\) mice per time point. Whole blood and plasma samples were analyzed for pSTAT5 expression across immune cell subsets and concentrations of IL-2 as previously described [37]. Alternatively, C57BL/6 mice were given a single dose of SAR'336 subcutaneously (SC) at \(0.3\) mg/kg. At \(3\)-, \(8\)-, and \(14\)-days post-dose, whole blood was collected from groups in K2 EDTA tubes followed by necroy and collection of spleen, thymus, and lymph node into cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with \(5\%\) fetal bovine serum and then disaggregation by \(70\)-micron filter. Blood and spleen samples were pre-lysed with ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) buffer (Gibco). Blood and tissue cells were stained with antibodies against mouse CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD19, NK1.1, and forkhead box protein 3 (Fox93) cells to assess levels of Treg (CD4\(+\), CD25\(+\), Fox9\(+\)), CD4, CD8, and NK cells. Antibodies used in these studies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.

### Flow cytometry of NHP whole blood samples

Blood samples were serially collected to evaluate the effects of SAR'336 on immune cells with flow cytometry. Peripheral blood samples were treated for red blood cell lysis and fixed with Phosphow" Lise/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, NJ) immediately after collection. Cells were blocked with human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) before staining for cell surface markers.

The following surface markers were used to identify immune cell types: T cells (CD3\(+\) [BD Biosciences, clone S934-2], CD4\(+\) helper T cell (CD3\(+\)/CD4\(+\) [BioLegend, clone OKT4]), CD8 T cells (CD3\(+\)/CD8 [BD], clone SK1), CD4\(+\) Treg cells (CD3\(+\)/CD4\(+\)/CD25\(+\) [BioLegend, clone M-A251]/Fox9\(+\) [BioLegend, clone 259D]), and NK cells (CD3\(-\)/CD7\(+\) [BD, clone M-T701]). Cells were permeabilized and stained internally with anti-pSTAT5 (Y694) antibody (BD, clone 47/Stat5(pY694) and anti-Ki67 [Thermo Fisher, clone SolA15] antibodies. Samples were acquired on a BD Fotterosa flow cytometer. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig 1.

### DTI model

C57BL/6 mice (\(n=10\) per treatment group) were sensitized SC with \(250\) ug keyhole limet hemocyanin (KLH) in PBS emulsified with equal parts of complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (\(0.1\) mL total volume) on day \(1\) and challenged with \(10\) ug KLH/\(10\) p PBS intradermally in ear pinnae on day \(7\). Ear thickness was measured prior to KLH challenge on day \(7\) and daily until day \(10\). Groups were dosed SC \(10\) mL/kg on day \(0\) and \(3\) with SAR'336 at \(0.03\), \(0.1\), and \(0.3\) mg/kg with a vehicle control (\(10\) mM histidine, \(5\%\) sorbitol, \(0.01\%\) polygorbate \(80\)). A group was treated with cyclospor A on days \(0\)-\(9\) at \(60\) mg/kg by oral gavage (\(10\) mL/kg in \(0.5\%\) methyl cellulose). Another vehicle control group received day \(7\) KLH challenge without day \(1\) sensitization. Ear thickness of the ear flap was measured in millimeters using an engineering micrometer prior to KLH challenge on day \(7\) and then subsequently on days \(8\)-\(10\). The animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation.

Whole blood from half of the treatment group was serially collected in K2 EDTA tubes at baseline and on day \(7\) via jugular venipuncture, and blood from the other half of the treatment group was collected on days \(3\) and \(10\). Staining antibodies for cell surface markers were added to \(50\) uL Brilliant Violet Buffer Plus (BD cat no. \(566349\)) to make a master staining mix. Whole blood was incubated for \(30\) min in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, \(1\) xerthroyles solution (Serotec BUP04) was added to samples, mixed, and incubated for \(10\) min at room temperature. Samples were washed, resuspended in cold BD Pharming Mouse Foxp3 Fixation Buffer (\(51\)-\(9006124\)), and incubated for \(30\) min in the dark at \(4\) "C. Samples were incubated with Fox93 for \(30\) min, washed, and acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa Flow Cytometer.

On day \(10\), ear pinnae samples from all mice were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded and sectioned at \(5\) microns for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Sections were blindly scored by a pathologist for overall severity of inflammatory infiltrates, hyperkeratosis, epidermal hyperplasia, and corneal pustules.

### Mouse CD4 T cell suppression assay

Fox9 cGMP mice (\(n=4\) per group) were treated with vehicle or \(0.3\) mg/kg SAR'336 via SC injection. Two days after injection, splenocytes were harvested and pressed through a \(40\) uM filter. Splencocytes were enriched for T cells using an EasySep Mouse T cell enrichment kit (Stem Cell Technologies) and subsequently stained with viability dye and a cocktail of mouse antibodies for CD4, CD25, and CD45RB. Live CD4\(+\)CD45RBloCD25\(+\)Fox93cGFP+ Tregs from all mice and live CD4\(+\) CD25-Fox93cGFP. conventional cells from vehicle-treated only were sorted with a Sony SH800 cell sorter. A \(15\) ratio of latex beads pre-coated with anti-mouse CD3 (\(145\)-\(2C11\)) and anti-mouse CD28 (\(37.51\)) to CD4 T cells were co-cultured with CD4 Tregs at the indicated ratios for \(3\) days in complete medium in a \(96\)-well round-bottom plate. Eight hours before harvesting plates, \(0.1\) uG1 of \(3\)H thymidine was added to each well. Cells were harvested and analyzed using a Perkin Elmer Microbeta microplate counter. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Normalized percentage of proliferation is calculated using the equation (cpm of Tconv cells treated with Treg/avg cpm of Tconv cells alone)*100, where cpm is counts per minute and Tconv refers to conventional T cells.

### Mouse CD8 T cell suppression assay

Naive C57BL/6 mice were treated with vehicle, \(0.1\) mg/kg or \(0.3\) mg/kg SAR'336 via SC injection. Two days after injection, splenocytes were harvested and pressed through a \(70\) uM filter. Cells were treated with \(1\)X RBC lysis buffer (Invitrogen) for \(2\) min, washed in PBS, and counted. Splencocytes were stained with a cocktail of mouse antibodies for CD4, CD25, and CD127. CD4\(+\) CD25\(+\) CD127. Tregs were sorted with a Sony SH800 cell sorter. Twelve vehicle-treated mice and \(8\) SAR'336-treated mice were used to isolate enough Tregs for the assay. Splencocytes from an additional twelve native C57BL/6 mice were similarly processed into a single cell suspension. CD8 T cells were isolated using a CD8 T cell isolation kit (StemCell) and labeled with CellTrace Violet (CTV, Thermofisher), following manufacturer's guidelines. A \(1\):\(1\) ratio of Dynabeads' (ThermoFisher) to CD8 T cells was co-cultured with CD4 Tregs at the indicated ratios for \(3\) days in X-Vivo" \(15\) medium + \(10\)% human serum. After \(3\) days, cells were stained with a viability dye and anti-CD8 antibody and run on an Attune NXT flow cytometer. Samples are gated on live CD8 \(+\) T cells for loss of expression of CTV. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

 

### Human Treg suppression assay

Fresh PBMC were enriched using StemCell SepMat50 tubes, following manufacturer's guidelines. Cells were washed, counted, and stained for 15 min with a cocktail of antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, CD127, and CD25 in PBS \(\mathrm{PBS+1\ mM\ EDTA+25\ mM\ HEPES+1\%\ FBS}\). PBMC were washed twice and filtered through a 70 uM filter prior to sorting on a BD FACSAria II Cell Server S10 RB27366. Live cells were defined as propidium iodide negative. CD8 T cells were defined as CD3 + CD56-CD8+ and Tregs as CD3 + CD56-CD4 + CD127-CD25+. CD8 T cells were then labeled with Cell Trace Violet (ThermoFisherFisher), following manufacturer's guidelines. CDs T cells and Tregs were combined at the indicated ratios and cultured in complete RPMI (RPMI + 10% FBS+1% penicillin/streptomycin) with nHL-2 (Gibco Cat. No. PHC0023 or Cat. No. PHC0027) or SAR336 on tissue culture treated plates pre-coated with purified CD3 (UCHT1) and CD28 (CD28.2) antibodies. Cells were cultured for 4 days and then stained with a cocktail of antibodies to measure proliferation by flow cytometry. Samples were acquired on an Attune NXT flow cytometer and are gated on live CD8 + T cells for loss of expression of CTV. Antibodies listed in Supplementary Table 1.

### Statistics

Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPadPad Prism. EC50 values were calculated using 4-parametric logistic curves. Animal studies utilized one-way ANOVA with Dunnett post-hoc test for statistical analysis. Treatment groups were compared to vehicle control. Significance was defined as \(p<0.05\).

## Results

Identification of pegylated IL-2 compounds that are IL-2Ru\(\gamma\) agonists with reduced IL-2Ru\(\gamma\) engagement

The structure of IL-2 bound to its heterotrimeric receptor complex [11, 12] has shown that the IL-2Ra chain (CD25) engages IL-2 distal to the IL-2Rb\(\gamma\) receptor subunits. Our previous studies employed the same semi-synthetic genetic code technology used in the current work to generate IL-2 variants intended for immuno-oncology indications with targeted PEG modifications on IL-2 at its interface with the IL-2Ra subunit of the receptor to block IL-2Ra engagement. This work led to the identification of SAR444245 (THOR-707) as a potent and specific activator of the IL-2Rb\(\gamma\) complex [9]. For AI diseases, we hypothesized that similar replacement of IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb or \(\gamma\) interfaces of IL-2 with nAs allowed by pegylation of these sites could produce a modified IL-2 with the reverse pharmacologic specificity. namely, a half-life extended pegylated IL-2 compound with reduced IL-2R\(\gamma\) interactions that requires IL-2Ra engagement for signaling (Fig. 1).

To identify residues that, when pegylated, specifically modulate the potency of IL-2 for the IL-2Rb\(\gamma\) complex, we selected 16 IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb\(\gamma\) and \(\gamma\) interfaces for production and functional analysis. Some of these amino acid sites, including V91, N88, and H16, were previously described [13, 14, 15]. IL-2 variants with the AzK substitutions in the designed residues were expressed as inclusion bodies in the _E coli_-based semi-synthetic organism, purified, and refolded (for full details, see ref. [9]). The refold AzK-modified IL-2 variants were then site specifically and covalently pegylated at the AzK residue using click chemistry via dibenzocyclodoctype (DBCO)-functionalized PEG molecules.

The resulting compounds were screened for differential receptor specificity and potency in primary immune cell subpopulations using multicolor flow cytometry and compared to previously described muteins and pegylated benchmarks (Supplementary Table 2). Potency was measured in fresh PBMC samples treated with either nHL-2, mutein, or pegylated IL-2 variants. After incubation for 45 min, samples were stained with antibodies to detect the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT5 (pSTAT5), a receptor-proximal marker of IL-2 receptor signaling, and a panel of surface markers to follow signaling and activation in specific lymphocyte subpopulations.

The results of the ex vivo profiling identified pegylated IL-2 compounds with a large range of potencies for Treg, CD8 + T, and NK cells (Supplementary Table 2). All pegylated variants showed measurable reduction in potency compared to the unmodified nHL-2 compound, consistent with previous, attachment site independent and non-specific reduction in potency mediated by attached PEG [9]. On Tregs, the target cell population, pegylated variants showed a distribution of potencies that ranged from 2 to 15,000-fold reduction relative to native recombinant IL-2 protein (Supplementary Table 2). Compared to Treg potency, each variant showed similar or enhanced reductions in potency for the off-target CD8 + T and NK cell populations (Supplementary Table 2), which express little to no IL-2Ra. These results confirm that PEG modification of IL-2 near the IL-2R8 and \(\gamma\) interfaces can modulate the potency of these compounds for stimulating different cell types, suggesting that the PEG modification may affect differences in receptor binding or assembly kinetics.

In vivo screening of candidate compounds identified H16 as a pegylation site for selective stimulation of Tregs with minimal effects on CD8 + T and NK cells

While ex vivo profiling of pegylated IL-2 compounds identified molecules that exhibited a large range of potencies on target Treg cells, these data did not allow assessment of how potency differences translate to in vivo pharmacologic activity. To elucidate the potential interplay between ex vivo potency and in vivo PK and PD effects, we performed an in vivo screen comparing the capacity of each compound to specifically target Treg populations in mice. After a single intravenous dose (0.9 mg/kg) of each compound administered to C57B/L6 mice, peripheral blood samples were collected. Comparison of maximal Treg expansion revealed that IL-2 with residue H16 replaced with AzK and pegylated with a 30 kDaPEG exhibited the highest change in peripheral Treg frequency (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, Q126 did not alter the frequency in peripheral Tregs (Fig. 2a) despite having similar potency to H16 in vitro (Supplementary Table 2). These results indicate that in vitro potency is not a good indicator of Treg expansion, as measured by frequency of all cells. The percentage of Treg, CD8 T cells, and NK cells present in peripheral blood cells after treatment with H16 or N88R/D109 is plotted as a function of time post-dose in Fig. 2c. While H16 or N88R/D109 promoted strong expansion of Tregs in the periphery, minimal to low expansion of CD8 T cells or NK cells was observed with H16 treatment (Fig. 2c). In contrast, Fc-IL-2 and pegylated IL-2 molecules at S127, V91, T123, and K9 promoted similar fold-change expansion in frequency of peripheral Tregs and NK cells. Since this analysis focuses on cells within the periphery, it could exclude any potential differences that may exist in recruitment of immune cells into tissue by these variants.

Comparison of PK profiles of each candidate compound demonstrated that H16 exhibited an extended half-life with exposure among the longest in the set of compounds screened (Supplementary Fig. 2), followed by Q126. Interestingly, compounds of higher potencies for Tregs and other cell types, including the IL-2 molecule pegylated at residue L19, generally showed faster clearance rates and lower exposure compared to compounds of lower potency, including H16 (Supplementary Table 2).

H16 induces expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation, and suppressive function in mice

As H16 demonstrated a superior Treg expansion and PK profile, we examined whether administration of this compound stimulated differential expression of markers that correlate with Treg function. Post-administration serial peripheral blood samples drawn from C57BL/6 mice described above were analyzed using flow cytometry for expression of markers that correlate with Treg activation and differentiation, including IL-2Ra (Fig. 3a), Foxp23 (Fig. 3b), Helios and ICOS, proteins known to be critical for Treg identity and suppressive function, as well as the proliferation marker Ki 67 (Fig. 3c-e). After H16 administration, the intensity of functional marker expression began increasing starting approximately one daypost-dose, and expression levels peaked between day 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). CD25, FovP3 and Kic7 signals were substantially increased over pre-dose levels, showing a 4- to 5-fold increased expression at their peak and decreased to near baseline levels by day 4 post-dose (Fig. 3a, b, and e). Signals for ICOS and Helios showed similar magnitudes of induction, with an approximately 3- to 4-fold increase over peak levels at day 2-3, albeit with a prolonged maintenance of expression levels and gradually decreasing levels to baseline after approximately 7 days (Fig. 3c, d). Together, these results show that H16 administration in mice drives Treg activation and upregulation of markers associated with proliferation and suppressive capacity.

H16 drives dose-dependent Treg expansion and expression of markers of differentiation and suppressive function in non-human primate (NHP)

To study the effect of dose level on peripheral exposure and PD, increasing doses of H16 were administered to cynomolgus monkeys and peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that, at increasing dose, the exposure increased proportionally (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and CD4\(+\) Tregs as a percentage of peripheral blood cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3b) or as a percentage of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3c) showed large increases the

At the highest dose evaluated (0.67 mg/kg), Treg frequency peaked at approximately 20% of whole blood and 60% of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a). Increased frequency of CD4 Tregs (Fig. 4a) correlated with an increase in total cells in the circulation (Fig. 4b). Minimal expansion of CD8 + T and NK (Fig. 4b) populations was observed at doses of H16 that drove substantial expansion of Treg populations. Similarly to mouse, administration of H16 promoted Treg upregulation in the intensity of CD25, Fox23, Helios, and pSTATS (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 3d), which correlate with differentiation and Treg suppressive function, and increased levels of circulating soluble CD25 were observed (Supplementary Fig. 3e), which peaked 96-120 h post-dosing.

### H16 extension of peripheral half-life and activation of Tregs in NHP is modulated by PEG length

To test the effect of PEG length on H16 pharmacology, H16 was conjugated to either a 30 kDa or 50 kDa linear mPEG. In vitro, H16 conjugation to a larger size PEG polymer (50 kDa versus 30 kDa) resulted in a modest reduction in potency ex vivo (Fig. 5a). When administered to NHPs, PEG50 conjugates of H16 showed significantly extended half-life (Fig. 5b) and exposure measured as area under the curve (Table 1), promoting a surprisingly greater peripheral Treg expansion compared to 30 kDa predicted H16 (Fig. 5c). Thus, all further studies in the NHP model were conducted using the H16 variant biocomiquated with PEG 50 kDa, hereafter referred to as the clinical candidate SAR336.

A single subcutaneous dose (-0.9 mg/kg) of the indicated variant was administered to C5/BL/8 mice. Flow cytometry was used to quantitate Treg (CD4 + CD25+ Fox23 +), CD8 T and NK cell expansion in peripheral blood.

Increasing the dose of SAR336 from 0.0025 to 0.2 mg/kg in NHP induced large-scale increases in the frequency of peripheral Tregs in blood in a dose-dependent fashion, in all instances, peaking at approximately 1-week post-dose (Supplementary Fig. 4). Similarly to H16 bioconjugated to a 30 kD PEG (Fig. 4b), SAR'336 promoted Treg expansion with minimal changes in CD\(8+\) or NK cell frequencies. Quantification of the induction of biomarkers for activation and proliferation in peripheral blood revealed robust induction of pSTAT5, Kit-67, and CD25. Similarly, levels of FoxP3 and Helios, markers that correlate with differentiation and suppressive function of Tregs in peripheral blood, were also increased (Supplementary Fig. 4).

SAR'336 engages IL-2R\(\alpha\) with high affinity, but does not measurably interact with IL-2R\(\beta\)

As the pegylation site in SAR'336 replaces a residue that makes direct contact with the IL-2R\(\beta\) subunit at the IL-2/IL-2R\(\beta\) interface, we hypothesized that this modification may cause differential binding kinetics to the IL-2R\(\beta\) subunit. To understand the mechanism by which SAR'336 demonstrates a bias for stimulation of Treg proliferation and activation over CD\(8+\) and NK cells in NHP, we used SPR to directly measure binding. The extracellular portions of the human IL-2R\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) were immobilized on the surface of SPR sensor chips, and concentration series of rhll-2 or SAR336 were applied to these surfaces. Binding to the

Fig. 3: **H16 administration stimulates increased Treg expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation and suppressive function.** H16 (0.9 mg/ kg) was administered via tail vein injection to C57BL/6 mice, and peripheral blood was recovered at intervals post dose. Multi-color flow cytometry was used to profile individual cell populations. The expression of CD25 (**a**), FoxP3 (**b**), Helios (**c**), ICOS receptors was monitored as the change in response units as a function of time during association and dissociation (wash) phases. On IL-2Ra surfaces, rhll-2 showed high affinity binding characterized by rapid association and slow dissociation kinetics (Fig. 6a, **upper left panel**, Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, SAR'336 interacted with high affinity with the IL-2Ra surface, with an approximately 3-fold reduction in affinity as expected for non-specific PEG effects on binding (Fig. 6a, **upper right panel**, Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, surfaces containing immobilized IL-2 RB showed robust association and dissociation responses with rhll-2 (Fig. 6a, **lower left panel**), while SAR'336 did not measurably engage the IL-2R subunit surface, even at high concentrations (Fig. 6a, **lower right panel**). These results suggest that SAR'336 retains interaction with the IL-2Ra subunit but lacks any measurable affinity to the IL-2RB subunit.

### SAR'336 specifically activates pSTAT5 expression in Tregs but not CD8 + T cells ex vivo

To determine how the reduced IL-2R$ affinity of SAR'336 affects activation of primary human immune cell subpopulations, we profiled the effect of this engineered cytokine on lymphocyte activation in human PBMC samples. In Treg populations, rhll-2 showed potential stimulation of pSTAT5 formation compared to SAR'336 (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that a slight reduction in IL-2Ra affinity and absence of IL-2RB engagement may significantly affect SAR'336 signaling compared to rhll-2. In CD8 + T and NK cell populations, SAR'336 was not observed to stimulate pSTAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 6b), unlike rhll-2. With rhll-2, potency in NK cells is 120 - 250-fold less than that observed in Tregs. However, a similar ratio of pSTAT5 induction in NK cells and CD8 T cells was not observed with SAR'336, suggesting that SAR'336 may

Multi-color flow cytometry was used to quantify (**a**) the percent of CD4+ Treg in WBC and CD4 T cells, and (**b**) cell counts for the CD4+ Treg.

Data are presented as mean \(\pm\) SEM from three animals. CD4 cluster of differentiation 4, CD25 cluster of differentiation 25, FoxP3 forkhead box protein 3, MFI median fluorescence intensity, NHP non-human primate, NK natural killer, nonTreg non regulatory T cell, rhll2 recombinant human interleukin-2, SEM standard error of mean, Treg regulatory T cell, WBC white blood cell.** be both reduced in overall potency and more specifically deficient in stimulation of the IL-2 \(\beta\) receptor complex in CD8 and NK cells that lack IL-2 Ra. Taken together, these results suggest that SAR336 is strongly reduced for signaling potency at the IL-2 R\(\beta\)F complex, but that this reduction in potency seems to be overcome by binding to the IL-2Ra subunit that is highly expressed on Tregs.

### SAR'336 treatment reduces inflammation in mouse DTH model

To confirm that the PD and pharmacological effects of SAR336 administration were not limited to the periphery, C57BL/6 mice were administered either the vehicle or SAR336 (0.3 mg/kg, SC administration) and peripheral blood samples and lymphoid organs were collected on days 0 (baseline) and 3-, 8-, and 14-days post-treatment (Fig. 7a). SAR336 induced higher frequencies of Treg cells in blood as well as secondary lymphoid organs compared to vehicle (Fig. 7b). After a single dose, 5-11% of cells in the circulation, lymph node, and spleen were CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, which translates to a synchronized 5- to 15-fold increase in the percentage of Tregs after 3 days, and a lower increase in Treg frequency in the thymus peaking on day 8 (Fig. 7b). In a mouse ear model of KLH-induced DTH, repeat dosing of SAR336 induced dose-dependent increase in Treg frequency that peaked on day 3, the day of the second repeat dose, and remained elevated 10 days after the first dose (Fig. 8a). At 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg dose, SAR336-significantly suppressed the amount of ear swelling (Fig. 8a) as well as decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into ear tissue (Fig. 8b) at 0.3 mg/kg dose, following re-challenge with KLH.

 

**Tregs treated with SAR'336 are potent suppressors of CD4\(+\) and CD8\(+\) T cell proliferation ex vivo**

As SAR'336 administration in mice stimulated the large-scale expansion of Treg populations, upregulation of markers that correlate with activity, and in vivo suppression of the DTH response, we hypothesized that the SAR'336-treated Treg populations have enhanced suppressive capacity compared to Tregs from naive animals. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with either vehicle or SAR'336, then splenocytes populations were collected at 2 days post-dose, harvesting CD4\(+\) Treg cells from SAR'336-treated and vehicle-treated animals. Next, CD4\(+\) or CD8\(+\) conventional T populations were analyzed using multi-color flow cytometry to detect and quantify pSTAT levels in different cell subsets. The plots shown represent the average (+ SEM) pSTAT5 fluorescence intensity, fit to a baseline restrained 4 parameter logistic regression and normalized to maximum signal to facilitate comparison of potency on Treg, NK and CD8\(+\) T cell subsets.

While study of the human cytokine IL-2 has been an area of intense focus in therapeutic development, efforts to utilize IL-2 and other cytokines for the treatment of immunologic disease has been challenging due to complex and pleiotropic signaling effects. In the case of IL-2, this cytokine displays dual functionality via both induction of immune responses through stimulation of proliferation of effector T (Teff) and NK cells, and control of immune responses through maintenance of Treg cells [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, N88 that modulate IL-2 potency to the IL-2 receptor beta subunit[31, 32, 33], our pegylation strategy enabled significantly differentiated properties to be identified in vitro and in vivo. The first step in this process was identification of residues that, when pegylated with a 30 kDa PEG modification, adjusted the cell-specific activity and potency of the resulting molecule. When the H16 variant of IL-2 was conjugated with a 50 kDa linear PEG, the larger conjugate was modestly reduced in potency (approx. twofold reduction in EC\({}_{50\text{s}}\) the half-maximal effective concentration) relative to a 30 kDa PEG, as determined by pSTATS activation in Treg cells. However, a single SC dose of H16 with a 50 kDa PEG administered to cynomolus monkeys unexpectedly produced a much larger exposure relative to the 30 kDa PEG bio-conjugate (3.4X). SAR336 with a 50 kDa PEG also induced a larger and more persistent expansion of peripheral Treg cells in NHP relative to the 30 kDa PEG bioconjugate. We conclude that peripheral Treg expansion in response to SAR336 is exposure-driven, with the size the of PEG bioconjugate likely limiting renal filtration and improving both compound exposure and levels of Treg expansion.

Our data show that SAR336 interactions with the IL-2R\(\beta\) subunit are too weak to be measured using SPR. However, the current models for IL-2 receptor signaling suggest that recruitment of the IL-2R\(\beta\) subunit is required for signaling[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 Teff and NK cells and these have shown remarkable Treg selectivity [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. However, typical residues targeted by such muting occupy regions of the IL-2 protein that are enriched for P1 anchor sequences that allow peptide presentation on class II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Indeed, initial variants that utilize these sites have generated anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation in human clinical trials, and we speculate that this may be a limitation of both the method and of the IL-2 variants that rely on this regional modification. While ADAs may limit the efficacy of a drug over time, muting that drive potential anti-drug immune responses may further lead to epitope spreading and neutralization of the patient's native protein [34, 35, 36], further limiting the use of these methods. In contrast, the mutien-generating approach presented here utilizes chemically stable covalent PEG modification, which may avoid involvement of steps in the class II MHC presentation pathway and limit subsequent immunogenicity and ADA formation, resulting in an overall safer therapeutic agent. The lack of ADA formation in clinical studies of the SAR44245 molecule further supports this contention [34].

Recently, Zhang et al. [35] presented evidence of improved PK and immunosuppression by an engineered IL-2 molecule in mouse models of AI diseases by orthogonally conjugating with PEG via copper-free click reaction through incorporation of azide-containing amino acids using a canonical amber suppression method to incorporate \(\text{A}\text{z}\text{x}^{\phi}\). Unlike SAR336, which contains a 50 kDa PEG at site H16, these authors utilized 20 kDa PEG conjugations at Y31 and T51 to achieve their desired phenotype. Using a different approach, NKTR-358 conjugated native rhll-2 protein with PEG moieties using standard chemical coupling methodologies [36]. In a single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 demonstrated a dose-dependent expansion of proliferating CD25\(+\) Treg cells. No measurable changes in the numbers and percentages of CD4\(+\) and CD8\(+\) T cells were seen, but low-level increases in NK cell numbers were observed at the highest doses tested [35]. Interestingly, the NKTR-358 compound has been reported to feature significant reductions in IL-2Ra, as well as IL-2Ra engagement, a substantial functional difference from SAR336. We speculate that these differences may arise due to the non-specific population chemistry used to generate the NKTR-358 molecule, which may target residues with undesired pharmacological consequences. Additional studies will be required to determine the differential and comparative pharmacology observed for these compounds compared to SAR336.

In the widening field of cytokine therapies for AI disorders, precision engineering of biologists will enable increased specificity and reduced off-target pleiotropy to be designed into natural immune regulatory cytokines. The application of the semi-synthetic genetic code technology to introduce site-specific and orthogonal chemistry via novel amino acids to achieve targeted bioconjugation of moieties led to the identification and design of SAR336, an improved, regulated IL-2 with enhanced PK and a more specific target binding profile. The concepts and strategies utilized here to

Fig. 9: **Tregs treated with SAR’336 are potent suppressors of CD8 \(+\) T cell proliferation ex vivo. a Schematic of the experiment to measure ex vivo suppressive capacity of Treg: mice were administered either vehicle or SAR’336 (0.3 mg/kg), and splenocytes populations were collected at 2 days post-dose. The CD4\(+\) Treg cells were isolated from the splenocytes derived from dosed and naive animals. Next, CD4 or CD8 \(+\) T cells were harvested from splenocytes from naive or vehicle-treated animals. To measure ex vivo suppressive capacity, Tregs were co-cultured at different ratios with CD4 or CD8 \(+\) T cells from naive or vehicle-treated animals. After 3 days of co-culture, the (b) CD4 \(+\) T cells and (c) CD8 \(+\) T cell populations from each improve IL-2 have potential for future development of other biologic scaffolds that would benefit from the site-specific modulation of potency, MHC-II epitope protection, and receptor specificity afforded by our technology. Together, the findings presented here demonstrate that SAR'336 is a specific activator of Treg proliferation and suppressive function, with minimal expansion of Tefs and NK cells populations. These results from mouse and NHP models support the continued development of SAR'336 as a clinical development candidate for treatment of AI-related disorders.
