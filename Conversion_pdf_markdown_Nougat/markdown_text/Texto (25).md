###### Abstract

Magnetic resonance (MR) is the preferred method for diagnosing craniphragmas. It best demonstrates the morphology of the tumor, its extent, and its association with surrounding structures. Variable appearance of craniphragmas on MR images reflects diverse histologic appearance. We present a case of an atypical craniphragmas with high signal intensity in all MR sequences.

## Discussion

There are two distinct pathologic types of cranipharyngiomas, each with its own theory of origin. The adamantinomatous type is thought to originate from remnant ectodermal cells of the craniopharyngeal duct, which are formed as a result of the migration of Rathke's pouch, a diverticulum arising from the embryonic buccal cavity that gives rise to the anterior pituitary gland (adenhypopphysis). The origin of squamous papillary cranipharyngiomas is explained by metaplastic theory, which suggests that they develop because of metaplasia and further proliferation of residual embryonal adenophylleal cells of the pars tuberals of the pituitary. The second type predominantly occurs in adults, whereas the first can affect all age groups [3]. Macroscopically, cranipharyngiomas are solid and/or cystic lesions; the adamantinomatous type often contains calcifications.

Although cranipharyngiomas are benign tumors the World Health Organization grade, they usually show a high recurrence rate and can be clinically aggressive depending on the location and size of the tumor [4]. Cranipharyngiomas are usually located in the stellar/parasellar region. The scalar region includes the sella turcica and pituitary gland. The parasellar region includes the cavernous sinuses, suprasellar (chiastolic) cistern, hypothalamus, and ventral inferior third ventricle along with vessels, nerves, and meninges. Compression of the optic chiasm can lead to visual disturbances, such as bitemporal hemianposia, diplopia, and optic nerve atrophy. If the tumor grows inferiorly, it can compress the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, which can cause a variety of problems related to endocrine dysfunction, such as growth retardation (in children), hypogonadism (in adults), neurohormonal diabetes insights, menstrual disorders, and hypothalamic obesity [5]. The most common symptoms are headaches, nausea, and vomiting due to increased intracranial pressure.

The diagnosis of cranipharyngioma is based on clinical examination along with radiological findings and is then confirmed by histopathological findings. Computed tomography is very useful in identifying calcifications that are seen in 90% of the cases, but MRI is the gold standard for sellar region assessment because it best demonstrates the morphology of the tumor, its localization, extent, and association with surrounding structures such as the hypothalamus. MR angiography helps to evaluate its involvement with the vessels and to differentiate a tumor from a possible arteriovenous malformation [6].

The wide range of histological appearances of cranipharyngiomas were reflected in their MR appearances. Adamantinomatous usually has cystic components and calcifications in 90% of cases. The papillary types of tumors are mostly solid. Solid parts and the cyst capsule are hypointense relative to the brain and show enhancement following gadolinium administration on pre-contrast T1-weighted images. The cystic fluid has variable signal intensity, depending on protein and cholesterol concentration, and is usually hypointense or hypointense on T2-weighted images [7]. High intensity on T1-weighted images was noted in cystic lesions with high cholesterol, protein content , or methemoglobin levels.

Atypical cranipharyngiomas have diverse MRI appearances, which can complicate their diagnosis and differentiate them from other brain tumors. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation, including clinical presentation, imaging features, and histopathological examination, is often necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment for these tumors. The management of cranipharyngiomas is challenging because of their location, invasiveness, and proximity to adjacent neuromuscular structures (pituitary, hypothalamus, optic chiasm, circle of Willis, third ventricle). This typically requires a multidisciplinary approach and should be individualized for each patient.
