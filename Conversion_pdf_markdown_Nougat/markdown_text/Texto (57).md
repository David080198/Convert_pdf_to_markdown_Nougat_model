###### Abstract

**Background** arrhyththmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a familial cardiac disease associated with ventricular arrhythmias and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Currently, there are no approved treatments that address the underlying genetic cause of this disease, representing a significant unmet need. Mutations in _Plakophilin-2 (PKP2)_, encoding a desmosomal protein, account for approximately 40% of ARVC cases and result in reduced gene expression.

**Methods** Our goal is to examine the feasibility and the efficacy of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression in a cardiac specific knock-out mouse model of _Pkp2_.

**Results** We show that a single dose of AAV9:PKP2 gene delivery prevents disease development before the onset of cardiomyopathy and attenuates disease progression after overt cardiomyopathy. Restoration of PKP2 expression leads to a significant extension of lifespan by restoring cellular structures of desmosomes and gap junctions, preventing or halting decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, preventing or reversing dilation of the right ventricle, ameliorating ventricular arrhythmia event frequency and severity, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling. RNA sequencing analyses show that restoration of _PKP2_ expression leads to highly coordinated and durable correction of _PKP2_-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes, revealing a broad spectrum of biological perturbances behind ARVC disease etiology.

**Conclusions** We identify fundamental mechanisms of PKP2-associated ARVC beyond disruption of desmosome function. The observed PKP2 dose-function relationship indicates that cardiac-selective AAV9:PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising therapeutic approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction1, Clinical presentation of ARVC progresses from a concealed early phase, a later manifestation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and ultimately heart failure that requires heart transplant1, ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1:1000 to 1:5000 with the mean age of presentation before 40 years old2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart disease that leads to abnormal heartbeats and a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. ARVC is often caused by changes in a gene called _PKP2_, that then makes less PKP2 protein. PKP2 protein is important for the normal structure and function of the heart. Human ARVC characteristics can be mimicked in a mouse model missing this gene. Given no therapeutic option, our goal was to test if adding a working copy of _PKP2_ gene in the heart of this mouse model, using a technique called gene therapy that can deliver genes to cells, could improve heart function. Here, we show that a single dose of PKP2 gene therapy can improve heart function and heartbeats as well as extend lifespan in mice. PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.

 organization of intermediate filaments, cardiac sarcomere, and other organelles [31, 32]. Mutations in the _PKP2_ gene are most commonly heterozygous in patients and lead to haploinsufficiency in PKP2 mRNA and protein [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, cated plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well of 96-well plates or at a seeding density proportional to the well size. A total of 5 million iPSC-CMs flooded three patterned 4Dcell 35 mm dishes. Seeded cells were maintained in CDI maintenance media (FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics) for 7-10 days until the day of treatments.

### siRNA knockdown and AAV transduction

To knock down endogenous _PKP2_ expression, four independent siRNAs against human _PKP2_ (Invitrogen) were tested to confirm silencing at both mRNA and protein level at time points of 2, 4, 6, and 8 days: 4390843 Silencer Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA; 4392420 Assay Id 5831202 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#1); 4392420 Assay Id 5831203 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#2); 4392420 Assay Id s531204 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#3); 4392420 Assay Id s10585 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#4). RNA sequencing analyses were performed on the above time points using 6-well plates with 4 wells each for the un-transfected, negative control siRNA (sNleg), siRNA #2, #3, or #4 against PKP2 (siPKP2) to select siRNA #3 and #4 for functional characterizations of iPSC-CMs in the presence of acute PKP2 silencing. PKP2 mRNA was silenced on day 2 and silencing persistent up to 8 days (the longest time for mRNA monitored by RT-qPCR). PKP2 protein was silenced up to 8 days (the longest time for protein monitored by Western blotting analysis).

A pool of #3 and #4 siRNAs or individual #3 or #4 siRNAs were used to transfect iPSC-CMs at a final concentration of 1.25 or 5 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in CDI maintenance media. Two days after transfection, medium was removed and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. Cells were fixed at above time points to determine the effectiveness of silencing using antibody staining and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencer Select Negative Control siRNA and siRNA #3 or #4 against _PKP2_ were applied to iPSC-CMs seeded on three 4Dcell 35 mm dishes on day 7 and fixed on day 10 post silencing for immunofluorescence.

AAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CR9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\({}^{\underline{c}}\). This AAV9 variant-based rescue was carried out by AAV transduction at different MOI, multiplicity of infection, on the 3rd day post siRNA-mediated silencing. After overnight transduction of AAV, media was removed the next morning and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. TN-401 expression cassette is composed of a codon optimized human PKP2. The codon optimization renders the coding sequence resistant to siRNA-mediated silencing.

### Evaluation of contractility and electrical signals of iPSC-CMs

Contraction of iPSC-CMs was recorded in bright field by SONY SI8000 imaging system and acquired videos were analyzed by DANA Solutions Pulse analysis software (now Curi Bio). Contraction was recorded daily from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction and day 5 to 10 post siRNA treatment. Each siRNA treatment included 6 to 9 wells on two to three independent 96-well plates. Contraction velocity was an average of all wells from the same treatment from the same plate. Averaged numbers of contraction velocity were plotted for each plate from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction. Beat period, amplitude, and propagation of electrical signal were detected as extracellular field potential signals from the cardiac monolayers using Axion Biosystems Microelectrode array (MEA) plates\({}^{\underline{c}}\).

Cell seeding and maintenance on 12, 24, or 96-well plates followed the manufacturer's recommendation. Data were collected at the time points and analyzed the same way as the contraction velocity.

### Immunofluorescence imaging of iPSC-CMs

Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before 15 min and permeabilized with PBS + 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBST) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS three times followed by blocking with PBST + 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells then were incubated with antibodies against PKP2 (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal PAS-53144) at 1:200 dilutions or DSP (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal 25318-1-AP; Sigma, mouse monoclonal MAET1492) at 1:100 dilutions or JUP (Sigma, mouse monoclonal P8087) at 1:200 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for overnight. After washing with PBS three times, cells were then incubated with donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 647 (Invitrogen) at 1:500 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for 2 h. Cells were washed 4 times with DAPI in the final wash, imaged, and acquired on either Leica DMBi inverted microscope with LAXS3.42-Life Science Microscope Software or Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System with MetaXpress 6 imaging analysis software. Confocal images were acquired from 9 independent cell areas for each well in a format of 96-well plates. Images in different fluorescence channels were merged using ImageJ software.

### Echocardiography

Transtracker echocardiography was performed using high resolution micro-imaging systems (Vevo 3100 Systems. Fujifim VisualSonics) equipped with a 25-55 MHz linear array transducer for mouse heart images acquisition. Briefly, lightly anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice (1-1.5% sublimate and 98.5-99% O\({}_{2}\)) were placed in the supine position on a temperature-controlled heating platform to maintain their body temperature at -37\({}^{\circ}\)C. Parastermal long-axis B-mode tracings of right ventricular outflow track (RVOT) were recorded for RV area measurement, parasternal short-axis M-mode tracings of left ventricle (LV) were recorded for left ventricle internal diameter in end diastole (LVIDd) and LV ejection fraction (EF) calculation.

### Electrocardiogram recordings

Mice were anesthetized with 1-1.5% isoflurane and 98.5-99% O\({}_{2}\) via a nose cone (following induction in a chamber containing isoflurane 4-5% in oxygen). Rectal temperature was monitored continuously and maintained at 37-38 C using a heat pad. Two lead ECG (leads II) were recorded from sterile electrode needles (29-gauge) inserted subcutaneously into the right upper chest with the negative electrode needle and into the left bottom chest with the positive electrode needle. The signal was then acquired and analyzed using a digital acquisition and analysis system (Power Lab; AD Instruments LabChart 7 Pro software version). ECG parameters were quantified after 1-2 min from the stabilized trace. For spontaneous arrhythmias monitoring, mice were monitored for 30 min after anesthesia induction. The arrhythmia severity scoring system is based on these 30-min recordings, please see Supplementary Table 1 for arrhythmia grade chart. This system has limitations, as the short 30-min recording interval and the anesthesia isoflurane can limit the types of arrhythmias observed. All arrhythmias were spontaneously occurring, with no electrical or chemical stimulation used for induction.

### Mouse histology

Mice were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine cocktail. First, mice were perfused transcardially with PBS. A scalpel was used to cut hearts into two along the coronal plane and drop-fixed overnight in 10% formalin. Fixed heart tissues were sent to Histowiz (https://home.histowiz.com/routine_histology) for trichrome staining and quantification of fibrosis and immunohistochemical staining of PXR2 and Cxd33 using rabbit anti-PKP2 and rabbit anti-Cx43 (PAS-53144 and 71-0700).

### Cardiac mRNA and protein analysis

Total RNA was extracted from iPSC-CMs or cardiac RV and LV tissue using the RNeasy Mini or Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, 74106 and 73404), cDNA synthesized (Invitrogen SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for RT) and analyzed by qPCR using Taqman probes to human _PKP2_ or mouse _Pb2_ gene, heart failure genes (_Nppa_, _Nppb_), and fibrosis genes (_Col1a1_, _Col3a1_, _Timp1_). Mouse _Gapid_ served as an internal housekeeping gene control. Absolute transgene mRNA copy number was determined by RT-qPCR using a WPRE-specific RNA standard (Script) across six orders of magnitude. WPRE RNA standard sequence and corresponding primers and probe for RT-qPCR are available in Supplementary Data 1.

Cardiac LV lysates in RIPA lysis buffer were analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-PKP2, rabbit anti-DSP, mouse anti-JUP, mouse anti-Cx43, and mouse anti-GAPDH (SC-39371, 25318-1-AP, P8087, 35-5000-3D8A5, and MA5-15738, respectively). DSP protein level in both supernatant and pellet was analyzed to ensure a complete evaluation.

### Statistics and reproducibility

The numbers of technical and biological replicates and animals for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Normality and Informality tests were performed first to determine whether a dataset is normally distributed. Statistical analyses, ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction, and Student's \(t\) test were performed using GraphPadPal Prism 9. Significant differences were defined as \(p<0.05\). Error bars in all mouse studies represent SEM (Standard Error of the Mean). Error bars in all cell biology studies represent SD (Standard Deviation). Statistical tests for each individual experiment are provided in the figure legend.

Statistical analyses for RNA sequencing data are detailed below.

### Transcriptional analysis by RNA sequencing

From each replicate, 100 ng total RNA was extracted via the polyA-tail-specific protocol according to Illumina Inc. RNA quality control was performed before library preparation using Agilent TapeStation instrument. The RNA libraries were prepared using a Stranded Total RNA Library Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (Illumina), which also removes ribosomal RNA. The libraries were sequenced as \(2\times 50\) base pair paired-end reads using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using V1.5 reagent kit on Si flow cell with an average of 25.66 million reads per each read file (51.32 M reads per sample). After adapter trimming by fastr (version 0.23.3), raw RNA-seq reads from mouse hearts in fastr format were aligned with Salmon (version 1.8.0) to the GENCODE (version M30, July 2022) reference transcript assembly (GRCm39 and Ensembl 107) using best practice parameters to ensure mapping validity and reproducibility (-seqBlas ->eBias ->posBlas ->useVBOtt -rangeFactorizationBins - ->validateMappings ->implicitStBT2). Next, a script using R package _tempor_ was used to generate an expression matrix normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). In this analysis, we only used genes detected in at least 10% of all samples. Protein-coding genes were determined using Ensembl release _mus musculus_ annotations (GRCm39, July 2022) and extracted by _ibromRt_ (version 2.52.0). Mitochondrial genes were also omitted, followed by renormalization to TPM. These gene expression values were then log2-transformed after addition of 1 as pseudo-count. Expression patterns of key genes associated with functions of interest were visualized across treatment groups with boxplots generated using the _ggplot2_ R package. Expression values from both left and right ventricles were included in the boxplots. Relative gene expression levels across groups and two ventricles are also presented in scaled values per gene in the heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_ package.

For initial assessment and identifying presence of cluster patterns in the transcriptome, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models were generated in R using the 'promp' function from the _stats_ package. The first two principal components were used to visualize group level differences across samples in a PCA plot generated using _ggplot2_ and _ggfortify_ packages with the 'autopid' function. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed by comparing each two groups of interest using Welch's \(t\) test on pseudo-log normalized TPM values. The obtained \(t\) statistics values were used to rank-order the genes for the downstream functional analyses. Volcano plots were then generated to visualize the top positive and negative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the _ggplot2_ R package. The top DEGs are the set of genes with the highest and lowest t-statistics values. To evaluate functional effects, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)\({}^{\alpha}\) on the gene list pre-ranked by t-statistics obtained from differential gene expression analysis, using the _clusterProfiler_ R package. GSEA assesses whether differences in expression of predefined gene sets between two phenotypes are concordant and statistically significant. Gene sets were obtained from positional, curated canonical pathways, transcription factor targets, Gene Ontology, cell type signatures and Hallmark collections in Human MSigDB (v2023.1.Hs)\({}^{\alpha+\alpha}\). Upon performing GSEA, these gene sets were only considered statistically significant if the false discovery rate (Q value) was less than 0.25 as determined with multiple hypothesis testing correction using the BH-correction method\({}^{\beta}\). The normalized enrichment score, which reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented in the ranked list and normalized for gene set size, was used to select significantly altered gene sets. Trends in normalized enrichment scores for some gene sets of interest were shown in heatmaps, which were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_.

## Results

### AAV:PKP2 corrected disease phenotypes in a human iPSC-CM model

To model ARVC disease and identify the molecular, structural, and functional signatures that are fundamental to the disease mechanisms, we carried out RNA sequencing analyses of iPSC-CMs after acute silencing of _PKP2_ expression. These studies revealed that the desmosome functions as a signaling hub connecting key structures\({}^{\alpha}\) in cardiomyocytes such that reduction in _PKP2_ expression led to down-regulation of structural and functional gene expression encoding components of desmosomes, sarcomere, intermediate filaments, and ion channels (Fig. 1a). Down-regulation of protein was shown for desmoplkin (DSP), plakoglobin (UDP), myosin-binding protein C3 (MyBPC3), and desmin (DES) (Fig. 1b, the left panel and Supplementary Fig. 1). Trending down-regulation of mRNA was shown for sodium voltage-gated channel a subunit 5 (_SCNSA_) (Fig. 1b, the right panel). PKP2 deficiency resulted in structural disappearance of PKP2 and DSP from the cellular membrane and caused cell disarray of patterned iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1c). In addition, PKP2 deficiency perturbed both contractile (Fig. 1d) and electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1e).

The 1st generation expression cassette was used for iPSC-CM-based studies and the 2nd generation for in vivo mouse efficacy studies (Fig. 2a). Dose-dependent protein expression was evident in iPSC-CMs driven by a cardiac-specific troponin T promoter (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). AAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CRS9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\({}^{\alpha}\), restored DSP expression post _PKP2_ silencing when compared to the reduced DSP protein without AAV rescue (Fig. 2c, d). AAV:hPKP2 restored contractility as quantified by contraction velocity when compared to the reduced contraction velocity without AAV rescue (Fig. 2e). Using human iPSC-CMs as a cell model for ARVC, AAV:hPKP2 restored desmosomes and rescued contractility in PKP2-deficient iPSC-CMs, suggesting PKP2 governs intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes.

### Pkp2-cKO ARVC mouse model recapitulated the majority of human ARVC clinical manifestations

We used a mouse conditional knockout model to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of AAV9-mediated _PKP2_ gene replacement. Consistent with the early observations of this model\({}^{\alpha}\), tamoxifen-induced cardiac deletion of both alleles of _Pkp2_ in adult mice did not show over structural and functional changes at 1 week post induction. Tissue collection at the end of the study and weekly monitoring showed disruption of desmosomes and GJs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3), high burden of spontaneous premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Fig. 3b) and occurrences of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (Supplementary Fig. 4), biventricular dilatation (Fig. 3d), and a sharp decline in cardiac function (Fig. 3c) and survival (Fig. 3e) after 3-4 weeks of induced cardiac knock-out of _Pkp2_. These phenotypes recapitulated human ARVC clinical manifestations. However, unlike in humans, heterozygous disruption of _Pkp2_ in mouse hearts did not result in cardiac phenotypes that closely recapitulated human ARVC symptoms [5, 6]. Thus, homozygous _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse was used as a model of human ARVC.

 

**TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment largely attenuated disease development and disease progression to mortality in Pkp2-ekO ARVC mouse.** To determine whether the AAV9 expression cassette (Fig. 2a, the 2nd generation) encoding either the human _PKP2_ or the mouse ortholog could counteract the effects of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion, _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given a single systematic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 (AAV9: human PKP2 at 3E13 vg/kg) or AAV9:mPkp2 (AAV9: mouse Pkp2 at 5E13 vg/kg) 3 weeks prior to tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 4a). A lower dose level of the human ortholog was selected to limit the risk of over-expressing the human protein in this mouse model. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was used as the carrier buffer for TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 to prevent aggregation of capsids. It was administered as the vehicle control to WT and to _Pkp2-ekO_ animals. There were 4 experimental groups: 'WT' and 'ekO' were treated with the vehicle and _Pkp2-ekO_ animals treated with either 'TN-401' or 'AAV9:mPkp2' as shown in Fig. 4.

At 4 weeks post gene deletion and 7 weeks post AAV treatment, human or mouse PKP2 inhibited the development of frequent PVCs and the occurrence of NSVT as summarized by a ventricular arrhythmia score (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Table 1 used as an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia burden), prevented right ventricular remodeling (Fig. 4c), and prevented decline in left ventricular function (Fig. 4d). Frequent PVCs, RV and LV remodeling, and LV function decline were prominent features of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 4 weeks post gene deletion. TN-401 demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing ARVC development and in extending median lifespan by \(\geq\) 58 weeks, far beyond the 4.7 weeks observed in the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-ekO_ animals (Fig. 4e). In this same study, we also evaluated efficacy of AAV9:mPkp2 in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 3 intervention timepoints and concluded that treatments at 3 weeks before, right after, or 1 week after gene deletion yielded comparable efficacy in EP%, RV remodeling, arrhythmias, and prolonged lifespan of more than 50% of the treated animals by 50 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, these results showed that either the human PKP2 or the ortholog was sufficient to prevent the detrimental cardiac and survival phenotypes of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice when delivered in the AAV9 vector. In addition, we were unable to detect sex difference in either _Pkp2-ekO_ mice or treatment groups (information on sex distribution in each study is detailed in Supplementary Data 1).

To assess the dose response to TN-401 (Fig. 5) or AAV9:mPkp2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given single systemic treatments via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, and 1E14 vg/kg one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 5a). All animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks post induction (3 weeks post AAV treatment) for histological and expression analyses. TN-401 treatment of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice showed dose-dependent efficacy in preventing decline of LV ejection fraction, reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight, and a trending reduction in arrhythmias (Fig. 5b). This dose-dependent efficacy was confirmed with larger cohorts of animals in significantly improving LV ejection fraction, reducing RV area and arrhythmia burden, and improving survival (Supplementary Fig. 6).

At molecular level, left ventricle heart tissue showed dose-dependent protein expression of human PKP2 (Fig. 5c, the top panel; Western blot images in Supplementary Fig. 7) as well as corresponding restoration of DSP and JUP, two additional desmosome proteins that were decreased in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice (Fig. 5c, the bottom two panels). Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein present at intercalated discs, was reduced in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry of heart tissue, and was restored in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice treated with TN-401 (Fig. 5d, the top row). TN-401 treatment also significantly reduced fibrosis development and collagen deposition in both right ventricle and left ventricle (Fig. 5d, the bottom row) and quantification shown in the right graph). In addition, quantitative analyses of molecular signatures supported that TN-401 treatment reduced mRNA expression of heart failure markers (a significant _Npp_ reduction and a trending _Npp_ reduction), fibrosis, and tissue remodeling genes in the right ventricles (only human PKP2 transgene expression was quantified) (Fig. 5e).

Overall, TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment supported a dose-dependent efficacy in improving ARVC phenotypes in _Pkp2-ekO_ mouse model of ARVC. TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 in the dose-escalation studies demonstrated efficacy at doses \(\geq\)3E13 vg/kg in preventing adverse right ventricular remodeling, and improving ventricular function, fibrosis, and electrophysiological properties.

The preventive mode of treatment, dosing before overt structural changes, demonstrated significant benefit of early intervention in largely preventing disease development and extending lifespan. To further examine whether ARVC disease progression could be slowed down or attenuated by restoration of PKP2 expression after overt structural changes, the therapeutic mode of treatment, we dos animals via retro-orbital injection of AAV9:mPkp2 at 1E14 vg/kg at 2.5 weeks after cardiac deletion of _Pkp2_ (Fig. 6a). At 2.5 weeks, overt structural changes were observed that coincided with a rapid development of RV dilation, LVEF decline, and significant ventricular arrhythmias (Fig. 3). Note that the rapid mortality presented by this mouse model (within 3-6 weeks of tamoxifen induction) combined with the relatively slow time course of AAV9 transduction and transgene expression make it challenging to perform the therapeutic mode of treatment. However, at 9 weeks post induction, AAV9:mPkp2 prevented further decline of the left ventricle function when compared to the treated animals at 4 weeks (\(p=0.9416\), ns) (Fig. 6c, f), reduced and reversed right ventricle enlargement when compared to the WT level (\(p=0.6856\), ns) (Fig. 6d, g). Arrhythmia scores showed a trending, but not statistically significant reduction (Fig. 6e, h). This therapeutic mode of treatment reduced mortality throughout one year follow-up with a median lifespan by \(\geq\)50 weeks (Fig. 6b), which is comparable to the survival benefit observed in the preventive mode of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6e).

**Restoration of PKP2 expression led to a highly coordinated and durable correction of PKP2-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes.** It was rather surprising to observe that restoration of a single desmosome component, PKP2, led to significant survival benefits, improved cardiac function, reversed adverse RV remodeling, reduced ventricular arrhythmia frequency and severity, and

prevented fibrosis. We asked whether "on-target" PKP2 effects possibly extend beyond its effects on the desmosome by evaluating PKP2 dose-dependent response, specifically at the transcriptional level. To our knowledge, there has been no reported study that reveals whether (1) PKP2 dynamically coordinates its gene expression with other desmosome members, and (2) to what extent PKP2 quantitively dictates the state of disease progression. To obtain a deeper understanding, two large-scale RNA sequencing analyses were conducted.

_Pkp2-cKO_ mice were given a single systemic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 3E13 or 6E13 vg/kg one week before tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 7a) and cardiac function and arrhythmias were evaluated at 4 and 9 weeks post induction. Mice were sacrificed at 9 weeks post induction and heart tissues were collected for RNA sequencing and quantification of PKP2 RNA and protein expression. At a 2-fold expression difference between 3E13 ygkg and 6E13 ygkg doses at 9 weeks (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 8), we did not observe significant dose-dependent difference in key readouts of EF %, LV mass, RV dilatation, and arrhythmia score, although one out of six PKP2 silencing and day 8 of AAV transduction, the left bar graph summarized the percentage of cells without GFP (\(n=12\) technical replicates, \(n=2\) biological replicates) and with GFP (\(n=24\)-\(36\) technical replicates, \(n=2\) biological replicates). The right graph showed restored DSP protein expression quantified by total intensity of immunofluorescence signal for Pkp2 silencing in the absence (\(n=6\) technical replicates, \(n=2\) biological replicates) or the presence (\(n=12\)-\(18\) technical replicates, \(n=2\) biological replicates) of AAV:hPKP2 transgene. Quantified data were presented as mean \(\pm 8\). Statistical significance was evaluated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test). AAV:hPKP2 showed rescue of contraction velocity post PKP2 silencing in 195C-CMs (\(n=18\)-\(27\) technical replicates for each day, \(n=3\) biological replicates). Call contractility was recorded from day 3 to 8 post AAV transduction and analyzed by Pulse video analysis (Curi Bio). Average nuclear counts from live cells were used to normalize contraction velocity. Quantified data were presented as mean \(\pm 8\).

## 5 Conclusion

We have presented these changes in response to TN-401 (Fig. 7e, genes of interest marked in red). Intriguingly, RNA sequencing analysis at the transcriptional level showed a positive dose correlation to TN-401 among structural genes encoding desmosomes, Cx43, sarcomeres, ion channels and Ca\({}^{1+}\) handling proteins (Fig. 7f). When examining expression of heart failure markers and fibrosis genes, we noticed a negative dose correlation to TN-401 (Fig. 7f). Therefore, while key functional readouts of efficacy could not be distinguished between dose levels of 3E13 and 6E13 g/kg, the 2-fold difference in PKP2 transcript levels achieved by these two doses did result in quantitative and dose-dependent changes in transcriptional signatures described above. Based on this observation, we believe that identification of key genes can be informative in associating a transcriptional signature with a particular phase of ARVC disease progression and therefore, may facilitate patient stratification in a more quantitative and precise manner, particularly in early 'concealed' phase when structural changes are not evident.

Transcriptome analyses showed that TN-401 restored expression of structural genes and attenuated expression of genes encoding adverse remodeling factors in a highly coordinated and quantitative fashion. We asked whether such transcriptional response can be sustained to attenuate disease progression and therefore, extend survival over a longer duration.

As shown earlier in Fig. 6, a single dose of AAV9-mPrkp2 treatment at 1E14 q/kg after overt cardiomyopathy batlied disease progression via reversed adverse right ventricular remodeling, improved LV function, a trending reduction in arrhythmias, and extended median lifespan by \(\geq\) 50 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion. Heart tissues collected at 51 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion were analyzed by RNA sequencing (Fig. 8a). Compared to intervention before overt structural changes (the preventive mode, animals dosed at 1E13, 3E13 or 1E14 q/kg), AAV9:mPrkp2 intervention after overt structural change (the therapeutic mode, animals dosed at 1E14 q/kg) showed comparable efficacy in extending life span at the same dose, 1E14 q/kg (Fig. 8b). PCA\({}^{3}\) showed that transcriptional profiles of AAV9:mPrkp2-treated _Pbz_2-_CRO_ animals were clustered close to WT and distant from vehicle-treated animals, suggesting a normalization of transcriptional landscape close to WT in response to the treatment (Fig. 8c). While the transcriptional profile of low-dose treated animals showed a partial recovery pattern, the transcriptional profiles of the high-dose treated animals effectively overlapped with that of WT samples (Fig. 8c). In addition, when comparing

B raw PKC traces showed a significant contrast in spontaneous arrhythmias in _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice in the absence and the presence of TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment. PVCs, premature ventricular contractions, NSVT, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The right graph summarized arrhythmia scores representing frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias.

When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant negatively enriched gene sets identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[4] were mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac muscle contraction, and cardiac muscle conduction. The top significant positively enriched gene sets were predominantly fibrosis related. Both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the

 preventive mode supporting the most complete reversal (Fig. 8e). To our surprise, the long-term survival benefit offered by either mode of intervention was supported by a broad spectrum of sustained correction of gene expression encoding components of the desmosomes, sarcomerey, ion channels and calcium handling systems, along with multiple pathways that regulate metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis as shown (Fig. 8f, g). Once again, both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the preventive mode effect being most complete (Fig. 8g). Quantitative RT-PCR validated that at the same dose, 1E14 vg/kg, each mode of intervention maintained a similar level of _Pkp2_ transgene expression at 51 weeks, suggesting the mode of intervention does not change the durability of the transgene expression (Fig. 8h). Expression of fibrosis genes (_Timp1_, _Colla1_, and _Col3a1_) were significantly lowered by both modes of treatments at 1E14 yg/kg except for _Col3a1_ in left ventricle in response to the therapeutic mode of treatment. Expression of heart failure genes (_Nppa_ and _Nppb_) showed trending responses to the preventive mode of treatment relative to the untreated cKO animals (Fig. 8h). In agreement with the observation shown by RNA-seq analyses, fibrosis or heart failure genes were reduced to a lesser extent in therapeutic mode than in the preventive mode among age-matched animals (Fig. 8f, g the top panel).

We concluded that long-term restoration of PKP2 expression by gene replacement approach was correlated with sustained restoration of a broad spectrum of structural genes and pathways, supporting a notion that early intervention is the key to restoring PKP2-associated intrinsic transcriptional networks and their functions and therefore, increasing overall cardiomyocyte fitness to effectively mitigate adverse maladaptive remodeling such as fibrosis as early as possible. These results strongly support that PKP2-associated transcriptional networks can be used to quantitatively evaluate the extent of disease progression and gene therapy efficacy at the molecular level.

### More than 10x an efficacious dose of TN-401 proved to be tolerated in WT CD1 mice.

A six-week pilot tolerability study of TN-401 via intravenous injection at 1E14 or 3E14 yg/kg in WT CD1 mice (Fig. 9a) showed no adverse effects at \(\pm\)10x an efficacious dose on body weight (Fig. 9b), heart weight and ventricular functions (Fig. 9c), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (Fig. 9d), liver weight and enzyme levels (Fig. 9e), and platelet count and hemoglobin levels (Fig. 9f). Histological analyses showed no TN-401-related changes in heart, lung, liver, pancreas, brain, kidneys, and skeletal muscle examined. Pivotal IND enabling toxicology studies conducted by Tenaya Therapeutics demonstrated safety of TN-401 in both mice and non-human primates. Due to the focus of this report, these data are not included, but were contained in the TN-401 IND application, which has received clearance from the FDA.

## Discussion

Our preclinical results demonstrated that AAV9-based PKP2 gene replacement approach can offer significant survival benefit in repairing cellular structures of desmosome, GJs, and Ca\({}^{3+}\)-handling system, improving cardiac function, reducing PVC frequency and occurrences of NSVT, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling in a cardiac-specific _Pkp2_ knock-out mouse model of ARVC.

About 50% of ARVC patients carry a genetic mutation in desmosome genes and approximately 40% of this patient population carries mutations in _PKP2_. The heterogeneity of clinical symptoms of ARVC indicates genetic composition, maladaptive remodeling, environmental factors, lifestyle, and other unknown factors of individuals likely affect disease onset and progression. Although mutations in desmosome genes have been confirmed as an underlying genetic cause of ARVC by large-scale prevalence studies [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], current understanding of the genetic background of this disease is limited and compounded by non-genetic factors and missing molecular links between defective desmosomes and disease development. Using both iPSC-CM and cardiac-specific _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse models of ARVC and AAV9-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression, this study demonstrates that PKP2 is the essential genetic determinant underpinning (1) intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes; (2) disease onset based on the preventive mode of efficacy studies, which proved AAV9.PKP2 effect to be dose-dependent with significant prevention of multiple disease phenotypes (Figs. 4, 5, 7, and 8); (3) disease progression based on the therapeutic mode of efficacy study, which showed reversal of right ventricle enlargement, halted decline of left ventricle function, a trending reduction in PVC frequency and NSVT occurrence, and most importantly, reduction of mortality (Figs. 6 and 8). As shown in our data, our therapies ameliorated arrhythmia severity by decreasing the PVC burden and the occurrence of NSVT. PVC and NSVT can trigger the differentiating arrhythmias and are associated with increased risk for SCD [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 restoration of PKP2 leads to a highly coordinated and durable restoration of structural genes encoding desmosome, sarcomere, and Ca\({}^{2+}\)-handling system components, supporting the desmosome as a fundamental molecular regulatory hub in maintaining cellular integrity and function of cardiomyocytes and the heart, overall (Figs. 7 and 8).

These data further support that an early intervention by gene therapy before overt structural change could project a better prognostic outcome by fixing desmosome-related structural and functional deficits to maintain the overall fitness of cardiomyocytes and to prevent irreversible changes that could compromise the efficacy of gene therapy (Figs. 6 and 8). If overt structural changes have occurred, gene therapy is not expected to be effective, for example, in removing fibrosis or in replenishing more cardiomyocytesytes. These irreversible changes were investigated in our studies as both preventive and therapeutic modes of intervention showed significant reduction of enriched fibrosis gene sets. However, reduction of fibrosis by the therapeutic mode was to a lesser extent with a concomitant trending higher expression of heart failure genes, _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ (Fig. 8f, g the top panel and Fig. 8h). The trending higher expression of _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ in the therapeutic mode of intervention might support observations that the natriuretic peptides encoded by _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ were functionally implicated in cardiac antifibrotic effects [60]. Significantly, both modes of intervention showed comparable survival benefit, dramatically extending lifespan.

Transcriptome analyses of long-term effects of gene replacement in the therapeutic mode did not have a corresponding age-matched control, which would be the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-cKO_ animals that had survived to 51 weeks (Fig. 8). It would be informative to understand the extent of secondary maladaptive remodeling that occurred after overt cardiomyopathy-pathy at the age of 51 weeks as the baseline for our therapeutic mode of intervention. This would allow us to determine whether the secondary maladaptive effects responded to the long-term treatment or to evaluate disease regression with pre-existing overt structural changes.

Cardiomyocytes lose due to atrophy or apoptosis puts unique challenges on what might or might not be responsive to therapeutic interventions in adult heart tissue. However, it is intriguing to see proposed reversibility of secondary maladaptive remodeling due to an overall long-term improvement of cardiac performance [61]. The long-term effects by gene replacement targeting cardiomyopathy remain unknown in terms of its potential for disease reversibility. Surprisingly, in our studies, long-term AAV9-PKP2 treatment after overt RV dilatation showed an increased expression of genes underlying sarcomere organization (Fig. 8g, the middle panel with Preventive/WT and Therapeutic/WT). This transcriptional signature could suggest a mechanism of partial regression of adverse structural remodeling due to enhanced sarcomere function in surviving cardiomyocytes. We are currently investigating this possibility.

There are several limitations inherent to this study. First, the majority of PKP2 mutations in human patients are heterozygous germline mutations. The presentation of disease phenotypes in PKP2-mutated ARVC patients progresses gradually with time as discussed in the introduction. In contrast, our proof-of-concept model is a cardiac-specific conditional knock-out model of _Pkp2_ with severe phenotypes that develop in a short period of time after gene deletion. Therefore, the robust phenotypes presented in this mouse model could possibly have different sensitivities to gene therapy relative to the more slowly developing phenotypes associated with human disease. Since all proof-of concept studies were conducted in mouse models, an important caveat is that the clinical efficacy of TN-401 and other PKP2 gene therapy programs or proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64] (https://rocketpharma.com/aav-presentations-and-posters/; https://www.lexeotax.com/post/lexeo-therapeutics-announces-data-presentations-at-the-26th-american-society-of-gene-cell-therapy-asgct-annual-meeting/) remain to be evaluated in patients with ARVC caused by PKP2 mutations. Second, our study designs and data interpretation were focused on how cardiac function, arrhythmia, and animal survival responded to the gene therapy and on determination of the PKP2 dose-function relationship. We are unable to use this model to evaluate germline impact on organ development and compensatory mechanisms in the presence of PKP2 mutations. Third, although amelioration of arrhythmias in response to the gene therapy was confirmed by EKG and supported by large-scale RNA sequencing analysis on restored gene expression of Ca\({}^{+}\) handling system, we do not have direct evidence to support a functional restoration of Ca\({}^{+}\) handling at the cellular level. We are currently investigating Ca\({}^{+}\) handling using isolated primary cardiomyocytes from heart tissue in response to the gene therapy.

In the studies we present, _Pkp2-cKO_ animals treated with the formulation buffer served as the vehicle control to the animals treated with TN-401 or AAV9-mPh2. Although buffer vehicles, empty capsids or AAV expressing GFP served as controls in other gene therapy proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 

## Conclusions

Using a cardiac KO mouse model of ARVC, we identified fundamental mechanisms behind disruption of PKP2-associated desmosome function and revealed its broad impact at the transcriptional level on Gjs, sarcomere, ion channels and Ca\({}^{2+}\) handling systems, and multiple pathways that critically regulate metabolism, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. These studies highlight the importance of identifying key transcripts in characterizing ARVC disease state and disease progression in a more quantitative and precise manner. Our efficacy data with PKP2 gene therapy and mechanistic analyses shed more light on understanding ARVC etiology andin practice, may help patients and physicians to make decisions regarding disease management and treatment.
