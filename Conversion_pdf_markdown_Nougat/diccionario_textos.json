{"\n\n[\n\n\n## Article\n\n* PV infection causes approximately 25% of all HNSCC cases and the rate has been rising in recent years [1]. HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC is biologically and clinically distinct from non-HPV driven (HPV\\({}^{+}\\)) HNSCC, which is typically associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption [2, 3, 4, 5]. Despite the availability of an HPV vaccine, modelling using current vaccination rates suggests a continued rise in cases until at least 2045 [6], indicating that HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC will be a clinical challenge for the foreseeable future. The most common treatment for HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC is surgery and high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation [7, 8]. While this treatment strategy curves the majority of patients [9, 10], significant long-term patient burdens can occur, including difficulty swallowing, kidney damage, osteor-adenecrosis, and delayed death due to chronic aspiration [11]. Because many of these patients with HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC will survive, they must cope with the toxicity of their treatment potentially for decades. Conversely, as the number of patients continue to rise, encountering patients with relapsed disease is becoming an increasingly common clinical scenario. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop accurate biomarkers to de-intensify treatment for HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC with low risk of relapse. In the meantime, it is important to develop novel and more effective therapies for patients with recurrent HNSCC because of their generally poor response to conventional treatment regimens.\n\nThe mechanism of HNSCC recurrence is not fully understood to date. Emerging evidence suggests that the amount, type, and levels of activation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with response to conventional therapy and immunotherapy or survival [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For example, a recent multi-omics study carried out on HPV\\({}^{-}\\) HNSCC identified actin dysregulation and immunoprecipitation, due to widespread deletion of immune regulatory genes, as important determinants of disease pathology and response to treatment [19]. Intriguingly, these insights were obtained primarily from analysis of the tumor proteome rather than the transcriptome as the protein data substantially outperformed RNA data in co-expression-based function prediction [19]. This is reminiscent of another recent study demonstrating that the proteome, but not the transcriptome, of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), was able to differentiate different tumor groups [20]. Furthermore, large-scale proteogenomic studies estimates that only 20% of protein-coding genes have high correlations between the transcript and protein abundance [21]. The poor-to-moderate correlation between the transcriptome and proteome data underscores the importance of characterizing the tumor proteome independently or together with the transcriptome. In this regard, we note that no systematic proteomic study has been carried out to date on HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC and consequently, the proteome of this cancer subtype remains unexplored.\n\nHere we report a deep and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of 15 HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC samples, including 7 with recurrence. Our study uncovered systematic changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome between the recurrent and non-recurrence tumors that suggests extensive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and reprogramming of the kinome associated with recurrence. Furthermore, numerous mechanism-based biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets emerged from our deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis, yielding a valuable resource for future exploration.\n\n## Methods\n\n* **Patient cohort.** Fresh tumor samples were prospectively collected from patients with HPV\\({}^{+}\\) oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer at the Victoria Hospital and London Health Science Centre, London, Ontario, Canada between 2010 and 2016. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at Western University (REB 7182) and informed written consent was obtained from each patient. The samples were frozen immediately after surgical resection using the optimal cutting temperature compound as cryo embedding matrix. Patient demographics and survival outcomes were prospectively collected. Frozen section analysis was carried out to confirm tumor cellularity greater than 70%. HPV status was confirmed via PCR and Sanger sequencing. All the primary tumor samples (NR1-NR8, and R1-R3) were collected before any treatment. For the samples R4-R7, the patients received cisplatin or radiation treatment until no evidence of disease was observed. However, their tumors redeveloped after the treatment was discontinued. The R4-R7 relapse tumor samples were collected by salvage surgery. None of the 15 patients received immunotherapy. Detailed clinical information is provided in the Supplementary Table 1.\n\n* **Sample processing for mass spectrometry analysis**_Tissue processing._ The frozen tissue was washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and homogenized in a pre-cooled mortar and pestle, then resuspended in 1 ml cold buffer containing 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2% (v/v) proteinase inhibitor (Sigma, P8340) and 1 mM NaF. The mixture was rotating-mixed at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 20 min to dissolve the proteins. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and mixed with 5-fold volume of cold precipitation mixture (containing 50% acetone, 50% ethanol, and 0.1% acetic acid) and incubated overnight at \\(-20\\,^{\\circ}\\)C.\n* _Cell culture and pervanadate treatment for the booster channel._ The patient-derived HNSCC cell line 93VU147T was tested for mycoplasma contamination and kept in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. T cells were isolated from blood of healthy donors. Both 83VU137T cells and T cells were treated with sodium pervanadate as follows. Briefly, the pervanadate solution was prepared by adding 10 ul of 0.1 M sodium ortho-vanadate to 10 ul of 0.2 M hydrogen peroxide (diluted 50-fold from a 30% stock). The solution was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Excess hydrogen peroxide was inactivated by adding 2 ul of catalase in PBS (10 mg/ml).\n* _Protein processing and digestion._ The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, and then redissolved in 200 ul 9 M urea containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, and 10 mM DTT. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sample was alkylated with 28 mM iodacetamide for 40 min in the dark and the reaction was quenched by adding 10 mM DTT. The sample was diluted by adding 700 ul 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovadate, and digested with LysC (1 mAU per 25 ug protein) for 2 h at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, followed by incubating with trypsin at 1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio overnight at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. The sample was acidified by adding TFA to 0.5% final concentration and was desalted on a C18 SPE column (Waters WAT054955). The peptides were eluted in 70% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid and dried by Speedvac.\n* _Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labelling._ For mass spectrometry analysis, we labelled 15 patient and 5 healthy control samples with the 11-plex TMT isobaric labelling reagent (Thermo A37725; see Supplementary Table 2 for sample identities with TMT set/ channel numbers). In addition, we employed the pervanadate BOOST channel approach [22] by including a 1:1 mixture of the pervanadate-treated 93VU147T cells and T cells as the reference channel (channel 1 of each 11-plex sample). Three sets of 11-plex reagents were used to label all samples.\n\nThe TMT labelling procedure was modified from Chua et al.[22]. Briefly, the desalted peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid to determine peptide concentration by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce 23225). Peptides in 180 g portions from each sample were aliquoted and vacuum-dried. A reference sample was prepared by pooling the samples C3, NR1, NR3, and NR6. Each of 0.8 mg 11-plex TMT labelling reagents was reconstituted in 41 \\(\\upmu\\)l acetonitrile. The peptides were reconstituted in 36 \\(\\upmu\\)l of 0.1 M HEPES (pH 8.5) to prepare 5 mg/ml peptide solution and were mixed with 13.5 \\(\\upmu\\)l of the TMT reagent to label the peptides at room temperature for two hours. After the reaction, a 1 \\(\\upmu\\)l aliquot was taken from each sample to check TMT labelling efficiency by mass spectrometry. The reaction was quenched by adding 2.7 \\(\\upmu\\)l of 5% hydroxyline. The 11 samples in a TMT set were combined (2 mg total peptides) and desalted on SepPak C18 cartridges.\n\nPhosphopeptide enrichmentWe previously reported that engineered Src SH2 domains called the SH2 superbinder (SH2S) could be used to enrich pTyr peptides for mass spectrometry analysis[23]. SH2S-Agarose beads (Precision Proteomics, London, Canada) were used for pTyr peptide enrichment. Briefly, the TMT-labelled peptides were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated with 100 \\(\\upmu\\)l SH2S beads for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The flow-through fraction was saved for pSer/Thr enrichment by Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)[24] (a gift from Dr. Mingliang Ye, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics). The beads were washed twice in 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate, followed by 2x washes in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The bound pTyr peptides were eluted using 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The eluted pTyr peptides were directly loaded onto the fractionation columns (see next section).\n\nThe flow-through fraction contains peptides not captured by the SH2S-agarose beads. Serine/threonine-phosphorylated peptides were enriched by Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-IMAC resin following a published protocol[24]. Briefly, a 500 \\(\\upmu\\)g portion of the flow-through fraction from the SH2S enrichment step was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA solution and then loaded to the IMAC resin. After incubation and wash steps (wash-1 solution: 50% acetonitrile, 6% TFA, 200 mM NaCl, wash-2 solution: 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA), the peptides were eluted by 10% ammonia, and dried by Speedvac.\n\nHigh-pH fractionationThe peptides were separated by Pierce high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo 84868). For proteome analysis, 10-\\(\\upmu\\)g portions of the peptides after TMT labelling were diluted in 300 \\(\\upmu\\)l 0.1% TFA for loading and 8 fractions (10-50% acetonitrile in 0.1% triethylamine) were collected. The IMAC-enriched peptides were resuspended in 300 \\(\\upmu\\)l 0.1% TFA and loaded onto the fractionation column. The SH2S-enriched peptides, upon elution in 0.4% TFA from the SH2S-agarose beads, were loaded directly to the fractionation column. For the IMAC and SH2S-enriched peptides, the peptides were eluted at 5, 10, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, 20.0, 22.5 and 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% triethylamine in a step-wise manner and the resulting fractions (8) were concatenated into 4 tubes (i.e., combining fractions 1-5, 2-6, 3-7 and 4-8). The fractionated peptides were dried on Speedvac.\n\nLC-MS/MS experimentsThe fractionated peptides were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptides were analyzed by the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method on an EASY-nLC 1000 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were loaded on an Accalam PepMap 100 C18 column (20 mm with 75 \\(\\upmu\\)m in diameter, Thermo 164946), and separated on an EASY-Spray ES803A analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the flow rate of 300 nl/min and a linear gradient from 3 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient length was 2 hours for the pTyr phosphoproteome fractions and 4 h for the proteome or the IMAC phosphoproteome fractions. See Supplementary Table 3 for parameters of mass spectrometry data acquisition.\n\nMS data processingFragPipe version 16.0 was used for data processing[25]. For the proteome and IMAC datasets, the pool channel was used as the reference channel for batch correction. Due to the reporter ion interference from the phosphotyrosine boost channel (channel 1) to the pool channel (channel 3) caused by isotopic impurities of the TMT reagents, the pool channel was not usable for TMT batch correction for the SH2S-enriched pTyr datasets. Instead, the technical triplicate sample (the tonsl control C2 in all three TMT batches, see Supplementary Table 2) was used as the reference channels for batch correction. The human protein sequences obtained from Unit-Prot (20367 reviewed entries, February 2020) were used in the database search. For the proteome data processing, the TMT10-bridge workflow was used for the proteome search (by changing to the plex to TMT11). For the phosphoproteome data, the TMT10-phospho-bridge workflow was loaded, followed by changing the plex to TMT11 and the minimal peptide length to 6. The median centering normalization by FragPipe was applied to the log2 intensities.\n\n \n\n## 11 Results\n\nThe proteome and phosphoproteome are significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.\n\nThe 15 tumor samples used in the MS analysis included those from 8 patients that were tumor-free and 7 with recurring tumors. The 7 recurrent samples (R) contained 3 surgically resected primary tumors (R1-R3) with future recurrence and 4 secondary tumors collected from salvage surgery after relapse (R4-R7) (Supplementary Table 1). We also included 5 normal tonsil tissue samples (C) as controls in the MS analysis. The MS samples were divided randomly into three groups for tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling (Supplementary Table 2). Each batch of TMT-11plex also contained a mixture of peptides from the HNSCC patient-derived cell line 93VU147T and T cells (upon treatment with sodium per-vandate) in channel 1 to boost detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides [22], and a pool of tumor samples (in channel 3) for batch-to-batch normalization [33]. To facilitate phosphoproteomics analysis, we employed the Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-IMAC beads to enrich pSer/pThr-containing peptides and the SH2 Superbinder (SH25) beads to capture pTyr-containing peptides prior to identification by nano liquid chromatography (nanoLC)-tandem MS (MS/MS) [23] (Supplementary Table 3). Collectively, our MS analysis identified 7288 proteins and 10,423 phosphosites, including 9253 pSer/pThr and 1170 pTyr sites (Fig. 1a) that were detected in at least 3 samples in both the patient and control groups. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest proteome and phosphoproteome datasets reported for HPV\\({}^{+}\\)-HNSCC to date.\n\nWe used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the proteome data and determine whether the recurrent (R) and non-recurrent (NR) tumor groups could be distinguished. We found that the proteome was segregated according to recurrent status (Fig. 1b). Intriguingly, the primary tumors with future recurrence (R1-R3) were located between the recurrence-free primary tumors and the relapsed, secondary tumors on the UMAP plot. This suggests that the primary tumors with future recurrence acquired certain characteristics of the recurrent tumors prior to disease relapse.\n\nVolcano plots were used to identify the significantly altered proteins and phosphosites between groups, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to identify the associated biological processes and/or functions. Of the 307 proteins exhibiting significant changes with recurrence, 284 were found increased and 23 decreased in the recurrent group. The proteins with the greatest increases in the recurrent tumors included the neutrophil collagenase MMP-8, neutrophil detensin 3 (DEFA3), neutrophil elastase (ELANE), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), collagen, fibrinogens (FGG, FGB), and components of the complement system or of thrombosis (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, the most decreased proteins in the recurrent group included CD3y, CD8A, CD2, and CD6, which play essential roles in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and/or T cell interaction with other cells (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table 5). This suggests that decreased T cell infiltration into the tumor is associated with the recurrence. GO analysis of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) further identified extracellular matrix (ECM) organization/regulation, neutrophil degranulation, and complement and coagulation as the most significantly upregulated processes/functions associated with recurrence (Fig. 1d). Comparison of the phosphoproteome data identified 157 significantly increased and 109 significantly decreased phosphosites in the recurrence relative to the no-recurrence group (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table 6). The phosphorylated proteins/phosphoites exhibiting the largest increases in the recurrence group included FGG-pY448, STAT5A/B-pY694/669, and SIT1-pY188. In contrast, MYH2-Y1381, CD8A-S231, CD247 (CD3Q)-Y111, CD3G-Y160, LCK-Y505, and VAV1-Y826 were among those displaying the largest decreases in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table 6). STAT5 phosphorylation (activation) is known to suppress anti-tumor immunity and promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion and survival [34]. SIT1 is a negative regulator whereas CD8A, CD3, LCK, VAV1 are positive regulators of TCR signaling. The significant differences in phosphorylation for these TCR regulators are consistent with T cell and TCR dysfunction in recurrent tumors. On the other hand, the increased phosphorylation of FGG is consistent with elevated fibrosis potential, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell migration--GO processes that were found specifically enriched in the recurrence group (Fig. 1f). Collectively, the differential protein expression and phosphorylation analysis suggest that the recurrent tumors are characterized with an enriched ECM, an increased metastatic potential, and a decrease in T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response.\n\n### Recurrence is driven by TME remodeling and increased EMT potential.\n\nBecause the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumor progression, we next analyzed the proteome using the knowledge-based functional gene expression signatures (Fges) that represent the major functional and cellular components of the tumor and TME [35]. Remarkable differences in specific Fges were found not only between the tumor and tonsil control groups, but also between the no-recurrence and recurrence groups (Fig. 2a). Of note, a significant reduction in the protein levels of CD8A, CD3G, CD3D, CD5, ZAP70, GZMA and GZMK, respectively, were detected in the recurrent group. Together with the results from the DEP analysis (Fig. 1e), this suggests that both the tumor-infiltrating and the effector function of cytotoxic (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)) T cells were compromised in the recurrent HNSCC. In contrast to T cell deficiency, the recurrent tumors were significantly enriched for markers of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs; eg., CD177, ELANE), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; eg., MRC1, CD68), and immune suppressive myeloid cells (MDSCs; eg., ARG1, CXCR). Although HPV-specific B cell responses have been associated with HPV\\({}^{+}\\)HNSCC [36], no significant change was detected for the B cell Fges between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups in our analysis beyond an overall reduction in B cell markers in the tumor compared to the tonsil control. In contrast, a moderate decrease in MHC-1 and MHC-II markers was observed in the recurrent group, suggesting that deficient antigen presentation is likely associated with recurrence. Collectively, these data indicate that the recurrent tumors possess an inflammatory and immune suppressive TME characterized with functional depletion of CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells and a marked increase in TANs, TAMs, and MDSCs.\n\nIn addition to the immune cells, the recurrent and non-recurrent tumors showed remarkable differences in the tumor stroma, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and ECM. A significant increase was observed for CAF markers, including PDGFR, FAP and collagens; ECM markers, including laminins, VTN (vitronectin), FN1 (fibronectin 1); and ECM remodeling metalloproteinases, including MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, and MMP9 (Fig. 2a). This suggests that the recurrent tumors are characterized with a rich and highly dynamic ECM, and thereby likely being more desmoplastic than the non-recurrent tumors. Moreover, we found a significant enrichment in the endothelium markers MMRN1 and MMRN2, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis potential. This, together with a pro-fibrotic and dynamic ECM, would contribute to increased metastasis for the recurrent tumors. Intriguingly, no significant difference was observed for the tumor proliferation markers MKi67, MCM2, and MCM6, suggesting that recurrence is driven primarily by TMEremodeling and the ensuing changes in the crosstalk between the tumor and TME, rather than by an increased proliferation potential of the tumor cells.\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process underlying cancer metastasis, which may play a role in recurrence[5]. To explore this link, we compared the protein levels of EMT regulators that were shown to mediate a partial EMT (pEMT) program associated with HNSCC lymph nodal metastasis in a recent single-cell transcriptomic study[28]. We found that the majority of the pEMT regulators were significantly increased in the recurrence group. These included the integrin \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\) chain proteins ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGB1 and ITGB6, the TGF-\\(\\beta\\) induced protein TGFBI, the serine protease inhibitor SERPINE1, the laminins LAMA3, LAMB3, and LAMC2, and the metalloproteinase MMP1, and the transcriptional MMP2 and MMP10, and thrombospondin 1 (THSP1) (Fig. 2b, c). In addition to the elevated pEMT program, a number of markers for hypoxia or stress response were found to be significantly different between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups, implying these processes in recurrence [5, 28] (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n**Rewiring of the cellular signaling network in the recurrent tumors**. The significant enrichment in ECM and CAF functional markers suggests that the recurrent tumors are characterized with extracellular matrix deposition, remodeling, and crosslinking which together would drive fibrosis to stiffen the stroma and promote malignancy [37, 38]. We investigated this further by examining the ECM-integrin/receptor interaction network. Compared to the non-recurrent group, the recurrent group displayed a global and significant increase in essentially all ECM components, including collagen, laminin, fibronectin, transcin, vitronectin, and thrombospondin (THBS). A concomitant and significant increase in the corresponding receptors, including integrins and CD36, was also observed. Besides increased protein expression, the ECM-receptor network proteins were more highly phosphorylated in the recurrent tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 7). Together, these data suggest a remarkably extensive and active ECM-receptor interaction and signaling network in the recurrent tumor to promote cell-cell and ECM-tumor interactions, ECM remodeling, and fibrosis.\n\nBecause fibrosis plays a critical role in metastasis [39, 40, 30] which frequently accompanies recurrence, we compared the key regulators of fibrosis between the NR and R groups. We found that the collagens COL5A3 and COL12A1 and fibronectin 1 (FN1) were significantly increased in the R samples (Fig. 3). LOX12, which promotes crosslinking of ECM proteins [38], was also elevated, reinforcing our earlier observation that increased fibrosis potential and stiffness of the stroma are associated with recurrence. Nevertheless, MMP8, MMP9 and TIMP1, a metalloproteinase inhibitor [41], were found simultaneously increased with recurrence, suggesting that activity of the MMPs was dynamically regulated. Fibrosis is often a consequence of chronic inflammation [39, 38]. In agreement with this assertion, we found the inflammatory cytokine IL1-\\(\\beta\\) significantly increased in the recurrent group.\n\nComplement and coagulation were among the most significantly upregulated process associated with the recurrent tumors from our DEP analysis. Because the coagulation cascade is intimately associated with inflammation and fibrosis [42], we examined the complement system and coagulation cascade and found that numerous components of this cascade were indeed increased in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 4a). Notably, the blood coagulation initiation factors F3 and F12, the coagulation factor F10, prothrombin (F2) and the fibrinogen subunits FGA, FGB and FGG were all significantly increased in the recurrent tumors, suggesting that both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are activated [43]. Similarly, numerous proteins of the complement system, including C2, C3, C5 and CFI (FI), were increased in the R group (Fig. 4b), implicating inflammatory response mediated by the complement system in HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC recurrence [44]. These data suggest ECM remodeling, activation of the coagulation, and fibrin formation/fibrinolysis play an important role in remodeling the TME to facilitate HNSCC recurrence.\n\nIn contrast to the upregulation of the ECM and coagulation and complement signaling network, the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway was significantly suppressed in the recurrent tumors. Specifically, numerous proteins involved in TCR proximal signaling, including CD3y, CD3z, LCK, and CD45, the key phosphatase for LCK activation, and CD48, a receptor involved in T cell activation, were all significantly decreased in expression and/or phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 1). Similarly, a number of TCR downstream signaling regulators or effectors, including VAV1, PKC0, NFAT, P38, and Erk, were down-regulated. These observations, which suggest defective TCR signaling, reinforce our previous observation that the recurrent tumors were defective in T cell function. Besides the TCR signaling pathway, numerous proteins of the spliceosome were seen down-regulated in the recurrent tumor, implicating defective RNA splicing in recurrence (Supplementary Fig. 3). In this regard, alternative splicing has been shown to play an important role in tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [45].\n\n**Kinome reprogramming associated with recurrence**. Protein kinases play a critical role in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis, which has provided a basis for kinase-targeted therapy in the treatment of numerous cancers. In fact, \\(>\\)90% of HNSCC is characterized with overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) [5, 46]. To find out if EGFR or other TFs and STKs (Ser/Thr kinases) are involved in HNSCC recurrence, we compared the kinase expression and phosphorylation levels between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Indeed, numerous kinases exhibited significant differences between the R and NR groups (Fig. 5a, b). Specifically, the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR, PDGFRB, MST1R, and PTK7 were found significantly increased in expression in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 5a, b). PDGFRB plays a critical role in CAF proliferation while DDR1 is a collagen receptor [47]. Together these two RTKs may play an important role in regulating fibrosis [47, 48]. The macrophage-stimulating protein receptor MST1R (or RON), which regulates the migration and activation of macrophages and activates wound-healing responses [49], may play the dual role of promoting TAM and MDSC recruitment and fibrosis. The protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) has been recently shown to mediate the crosstalk between the tumor cells and CAFs and to promote cancer stemness in head and neck cancer [50]. Its upregulation in recurrent tumors suggests that increased cancer stemness is associated with recurrence. In addition to the RTKs, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (CTKs) YES1, which may be recruited to activated EGFR and PDGFRB, was also significantly upregulated in the R group. YES1 activation may be corroborated by decreased CSK, a negative regulator of the Src family kinases.\n\nFig. 1: The proteome and phosphoproteome are distinct between non-recurrent and recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC.

Moreover, numerous STKs exhibited elevated (Fig. 5c) or reduced (Supplementary Fig. 4) phosphorylation in the recurrent tumors.

The phosphorylation levels of these proteins were also significantly reduced in the recurrent tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, a significant decrease in phosphorylation was observed for the TCR and BCR (B cell receptor) proximal kinases LCK and SYK at their respective activation loop Tyr sites, indicating, once again, decreased T/B cell function in the recurrent tumors.\n\nCollectively, these data suggest that a broad reprogramming of the kinome at both the protein and phosphorylation level underlies recurrence. Importantly, the reprogrammed TFs/STKs form an extensive protein-protein interaction and signaling network that regulate the multiple processes that are altered in the recurrent tumors, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, ECM remodeling, EMT, neutrophil function and coagulation/thrombosis (Fig. 5d).\n\n**Predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for recurrent HNSCC.** Besides generating mechanistic insights, a major motivation of this study is to identify predictive biomarkers for patient stratification and novel therapeutic targets. Of the hundreds of differentially expressed and/or differentially phosphorylated proteins, many are potential therapeutic targets based on the DrugBank, a database of FDA-approved therapeutic targets [53]. The list of therapeutic targets identified herein contained not only protein kinases such as PDGFR, EGFR, MAP2K2, PDKCD, and JUN, but also regulators of fibrosis, coagulation/ complement systems, neutrophil function, and inflammation, including MMP9, fibrinogens, PROS1, C5, C3, ELANE, FCGR3A and IL1B (Fig. 6a, b). MMP9, which tops the list of candidate therapeutic targets, plays an essential role in local ECM degradation, leukocyte migration and EMT. Because aberrant regulation of these processes underlies recurrence of HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC, targeting MMP9 and its regulators may be a plausible approach by which to curb recurrence [54]. In this regard, the expression of MMP9 is found to be controlled by an elaborate PPI network that include the upstream regulators EGFR, PTK2, MAPK5, IGFBP7, IL1B, STAT5A, FOS/JUN, and CCL5 (Fig. 6c). While EGFR, PTK2 (FAK) and MAPK9 may directly regulate FOS, the cytokine IL1B [54] may regulate JUN directly or indirectly via CCL5 which also plays a critical role in monocyte recruitment and TAM infiltration within tumors [55, 56]. Therefore, targeting these regulators, especially when in combination, provides an alternative means to targeting MMP9.\n\nPersonalized treatment of HNSCC based on recurrence potential would greatly enhance the efficacy of treatment for the recurrent cases and reduce morbidity of patients with non-recurrent cancer. Towards this goal, we next aimed at identifying predictive biomarkers of recurrence, by investigating a correlation between our proteomic observations and clinical samples from other cohorts. Because a database for HNSCC recurrence is unavailable, we resorted to predict patient survival using the TCGA HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC database [57] (\\(n=71\\)). A predictive marker was chosen when the following three conditions were met: (1) the protein abundance was significantly different between the NR and R groups, (2) the protein is an FDA-approved drug target (Fig. 6a, b), and (3) the expression of the marker is significantly correlated with patient survival. Our analysis identified eight potential biomarkers of HNSCC recurrence, namely PROS1, ANXA3, COL2A1, F3, TUBB3, PSMB5, SLC/A11/xCT, and CD2 (Fig. 7a). Most of these proteins are involved in the identified fibrosis or coagulation pathways/PPI networks associated with recurrence (Figs. 3, 4). The SLC/A11/xCT pSer26 site is a substrate of the kinase complex mTOR2 [58], whose activation has been implicated in HNSCC disease progression [59]. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that reduced expression of any of these markers, except for CD2, was significantly associated with improved disease-specific survival. In contrast, a high expression level of the T cell marker CD2 was correlated with better outcome (Fig. 7b).\n\nFootnote 2: https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-0059-8\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomics analysis of recurrent and non-recurrent tumors indicate the tumor micro-environment (TME) plays an essential role in HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC recurrence. The TME comprises immune cells, blood vessels, and the stroma, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the extracellular matrix [60]. We found that the recurrent tumors differ significantly from the non-recurrent tumors in these hallmark features. First, the recurrent tumors are characterized with an inflammatory and suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) [61], characterized with increased TANs and TAMs, decreased antigen presentation, and deficient T/B cell function [62]. This suggests that the immune evasion by the recurrent tumor is mediated by the lymphoid and myeloid cells [63]. The enrichment of TANs is consistent with a recent observation that later stage oral squamous cell carcinoma patients have elevated plasma neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [64]. This also provides an explanation for hypercoagulability, a major cancer-associated complication linked to poor patient prognosis, observed in the recurrent samples. Second, we found a remarkable and significant increase in CAFs in the recurrent group, suggesting fibrosis or a prolvity for fibrosis underlies recurrence. The CAFs are not only major contributors of cancer fibrosis through increased collagen crosslinking, but they may also promote tumorigenesis through the collagen-integrin and collagen-RTX signaling networks. In the same vein, the role of CAFs in promoting EMT has been observed in multiple cancer types [65]. Third, the TME is enriched in ECM and ECM remodeling proteins. ECM deposition, remodeling and crosslinking can drive fibrosis to stiff the stroma, which, in turn, enhance tumor progression, aggression, angiogenesis, and hypoxia [76, 37]. Matrix-rich, fibrotic tumors are also associated with poor immunity characterized with poor T cell penetration and activation. Finally, the crosstalk between the tumor cells, CAFs, immune cells and ECM may promote tumor progression, tumor cell intravasation and metastasis, leading to cancer relapse [77, 38, 36]. Indeed, we found that the recurrent tumors were enriched in genes mediating a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal (pEMT) program, reminiscent of the finding from a recent single cell RNA analysis of matched primary and lymph node metastasis HNSCC (mainly the HPV\\({}^{-}\\) subtype) [28]. This suggests that an increased EMT potential is associated with HNSCC recurrence in general regardless of the HPV infection status.\n\nTME remodeling is likely driven by the corresponding changes in the underlying signaling pathways and/or protein-protein interaction networks. That essentially all components of the ECM-integrin signaling network are significantly over-expressed and hyper-phosphorylated suggest ECM dynamics and remodeling are cardinal features of HNSCC recurrence. The involvement of the coagulation/thrombosis pathway and the\n\nFigure 5: **Fione reprogramming in the recurrent tumor.**a) Heatmap of protein kinases with significantly increased or decreased expression in the recurrent tumors (>2-fold difference and \\(p<0.1\\) between the NR and R groups).

In this regard, it would be of interest to confirm this assertion by proteomic analysis of an HPV- HNSCC cohort. Depletion of T cells has been associated with recurrent HNSCC, and our study suggests that both tumor infiltration and function of CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells are compromised in the HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. A recent study has identified the spliceosome pathway as a key cellular function elevated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma[68]. However, our proteomic data suggests that the RNA splicing pathway is compromised in the recurrent HNSCC.\n\nBecause EGFR is overexpressed in 80-90% HNSCC, we investigated the role of protein kinases and kinase signaling in recurrence. Indeed, we have identified significant changes in the expression and/or phosphorylation of numerous TFs and STKs,\n\nFig. 6: **Candidate therapeutic targets for precision treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\)HNSCC.** A Heatmap showing overexpression of a list of FDA-approved therapeutic targets in the recurrent tumors.

Of note, an altered kinase signaling network involving EGFR, PDGFR, PAKI, PTK2 (FAK), PRKCD, and MAPK2 appear to regulate the aberrant changes in the cancer cells and the TME accompanying recurrence.\n\nOur investigation into the mechanism of HNSCC recurrence led to the discovery of numerous potential therapeutic targets. Some targets, including EGFR, PDGFR, FAK, CXCR4, and MMP9, have corresponding inhibitors that have been approved or are under active clinical trials for cancer treatment. Our study suggests that these inhibitors may be repurposed for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. Although the EGFR antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV\\({}^{-}\\) HNSCC where cytotoxic chemotherapy is not the best\n\nFig. 7: **Potential biomarkers for predicting recurrence and survival.** a Box plots of representative biomarkers emerging from this study. \\(P\\) values shown were based on Student\u2019s t-test.

For each gene, the 71 patients were divided into high expression (_n_ = 36) or low expression (_n_ = 35) group, and the disease-specific survival months were plotted. The dotted lines show 95% confidence intervals.\n\n option due to comorbidities, our data suggests that cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used to preempt or treat recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. In the same vein, FDA-approved PDGFR inhibitors may be used in the above combination therapies owing to its critical role in promoting tumorigenesis and fibrosis. Because both EGFR and PDGFR signal through MAP2K2 (MEK2), the latter of which is significantly activated in the recurrent tumors, pharmacological blockade of MAP2K2 activity may be an alternative approach for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. Furthermore, our work led to the identification of \\(>\\)30 potential FDA-approved therapeutic targets for exploration and validation [53].\n\nCheckpoint blockade immunotherapies benefit only 20-30% of HNSCC patients [61]. This moderate rate of response demands for better understanding of the immune landscape of HNSCC. The recurrent tumors may be more resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as collagen can promote anti-PD-1/PD-L1 resistance via CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cell exhaustion [69]. Reducing collagen deposition by inhibiting LOXL2, which promotes crosslinking of ECM proteins and is significantly upregulated in the recurrent HNSCC, maybe a potential approach to activate the exhausted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy as demonstrated recently for lung cancer in a mouse model [69]. In this regard, it is worth noting that an LOXL2 blocking antibody is currently in preclinical and clinical fibrosis trials [66]. Other CAF-targeting drugs that are currently under clinical trials may also be repurposed for the treatment of recurrent HNSCC, including inhibitors of FAK (PTK2), ROCK, and CXCR which we have found to be significantly overexpressed and/or hyper-activated in the recurrent tumors. While FAK and ROCK are key regulators of the cytoskeleton, CXCR4 is expressed by monocytes or monocytic MDSCs [55]. Therefore, the TME provides a wealth of potential therapeutic targets for future exploration. Our work further suggests that, apart from targeting exhausted T cells, the myeloid cell population affords an attractive immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC.\n\nOur recurrent tumor samples contained both primary tumors with future recurrence and resected tissues from relapsed tumors. That the proteome and phosphoproteome of these two sets of samples converge on the key features identified herein suggest that it is possible to predict recurrence using the primary tumor biopsy prior to disease relapse. In support of this, several proteins identified to play an important role in recurrence are capable of predicting patient survival using an independent TCGA HNSCC cohort. These potential biomarkers, including PROS1, ANX3, F3, COL2A1, TUBB3, PSM5B5, SLC7A11/xCT and CD2, are key regulators of fibrosis, coagulation, metastasis, or immune responses. PROS1 and F3 are particularly attractive biomarkers because they are secreted proteins. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if these proteins are also elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with recurrent disease.\n\nA key limitation of our study is the modest sample size. Despite this, our proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis has identified a number of TME features associated with recurrence. Our study highlights the need to conduct deep and quantitative proteomic analysis independently or in combination with transcriptomic profiling to better understand the systems basis of cancer recurrence and/or metastasis to inform prognosis and treatment of recurrent/metastatic cancers.\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data for the figures are provided as Supplementary Data 2, 3.

HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC is biologically and clinically distinct from non-HPV driven (HPV\\({}^{+}\\)) HNSCC, which is typically associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption [2, 3, 4, 5]. Despite the availability of an HPV vaccine, modelling using current vaccination rates suggests a continued rise in cases until at least 2045 [6], indicating that HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC will be a clinical challenge for the foreseeable future. The most common treatment for HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC is surgery and high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation [7, 8]. While this treatment strategy curves the majority of patients [9, 10], significant long-term patient burdens can occur, including difficulty swallowing, kidney damage, osteor-adenecrosis, and delayed death due to chronic aspiration [11]. Because many of these patients with HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC will survive, they must cope with the toxicity of their treatment potentially for decades. Conversely, as the number of patients continue to rise, encountering patients with relapsed disease is becoming an increasingly common clinical scenario. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop accurate biomarkers to de-intensify treatment for HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC with low risk of relapse. In the meantime, it is important to develop novel and more effective therapies for patients with recurrent HNSCC because of their generally poor response to conventional treatment regimens.\n\nThe mechanism of HNSCC recurrence is not fully understood to date. Emerging evidence suggests that the amount, type, and levels of activation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with response to conventional therapy and immunotherapy or survival [12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. For example, a recent multi-omics study carried out on HPV\\({}^{-}\\) HNSCC identified actin dysregulation and immunoprecipitation, due to widespread deletion of immune regulatory genes, as important determinants of disease pathology and response to treatment [19]. Intriguingly, these insights were obtained primarily from analysis of the tumor proteome rather than the transcriptome as the protein data substantially outperformed RNA data in co-expression-based function prediction [19]. This is reminiscent of another recent study demonstrating that the proteome, but not the transcriptome, of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), was able to differentiate different tumor groups [20]. Furthermore, large-scale proteogenomic studies estimates that only 20% of protein-coding genes have high correlations between the transcript and protein abundance [21]. The poor-to-moderate correlation between the transcriptome and proteome data underscores the importance of characterizing the tumor proteome independently or together with the transcriptome. In this regard, we note that no systematic proteomic study has been carried out to date on HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC and consequently, the proteome of this cancer subtype remains unexplored.\n\nHere we report a deep and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of 15 HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC samples, including 7 with recurrence. Our study uncovered systematic changes in the proteome and phosphoproteome between the recurrent and non-recurrence tumors that suggests extensive remodeling of the tumor microenvironment and reprogramming of the kinome associated with recurrence. Furthermore, numerous mechanism-based biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets emerged from our deep proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis, yielding a valuable resource for future exploration.\n\n## ", "Methods": "\n\n* **Patient cohort.** Fresh tumor samples were prospectively collected from patients with HPV\\({}^{+}\\) oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer at the Victoria Hospital and London Health Science Centre, London, Ontario, Canada between 2010 and 2016.

HPV status was confirmed via PCR and Sanger sequencing. All the primary tumor samples (NR1-NR8, and R1-R3) were collected before any treatment. For the samples R4-R7, the patients received cisplatin or radiation treatment until no evidence of disease was observed. However, their tumors redeveloped after the treatment was discontinued. The R4-R7 relapse tumor samples were collected by salvage surgery. None of the 15 patients received immunotherapy. Detailed clinical information is provided in the Supplementary Table 1.\n\n* **Sample processing for mass spectrometry analysis**_Tissue processing._ The frozen tissue was washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once and homogenized in a pre-cooled mortar and pestle, then resuspended in 1 ml cold buffer containing 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2% (v/v) proteinase inhibitor (Sigma, P8340) and 1 mM NaF. The mixture was rotating-mixed at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 20 min to dissolve the proteins. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube and mixed with 5-fold volume of cold precipitation mixture (containing 50% acetone, 50% ethanol, and 0.1% acetic acid) and incubated overnight at \\(-20\\,^{\\circ}\\)C.\n* _Cell culture and pervanadate treatment for the booster channel._ The patient-derived HNSCC cell line 93VU147T was tested for mycoplasma contamination and kept in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. T cells were isolated from blood of healthy donors. Both 83VU137T cells and T cells were treated with sodium pervanadate as follows. Briefly, the pervanadate solution was prepared by adding 10 ul of 0.1 M sodium ortho-vanadate to 10 ul of 0.2 M hydrogen peroxide (diluted 50-fold from a 30% stock). The solution was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Excess hydrogen peroxide was inactivated by adding 2 ul of catalase in PBS (10 mg/ml).\n* _Protein processing and digestion._ The protein precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, and then redissolved in 200 ul 9 M urea containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, and 10 mM DTT. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sample was alkylated with 28 mM iodacetamide for 40 min in the dark and the reaction was quenched by adding 10 mM DTT. The sample was diluted by adding 700 ul 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM sodium orthovadate, and digested with LysC (1 mAU per 25 ug protein) for 2 h at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, followed by incubating with trypsin at 1:50 enzyme-to-substrate ratio overnight at 28 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. The sample was acidified by adding TFA to 0.5% final concentration and was desalted on a C18 SPE column (Waters WAT054955). The peptides were eluted in 70% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid and dried by Speedvac.\n* _Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labelling._ For mass spectrometry analysis, we labelled 15 patient and 5 healthy control samples with the 11-plex TMT isobaric labelling reagent (Thermo A37725; see Supplementary Table 2 for sample identities with TMT set/ channel numbers). In addition, we employed the pervanadate BOOST channel approach [22] by including a 1:1 mixture of the pervanadate-treated 93VU147T cells and T cells as the reference channel (channel 1 of each 11-plex sample). Three sets of 11-plex reagents were used to label all samples.\n\nThe TMT labelling procedure was modified from Chua et al.[22]. Briefly, the desalted peptides were reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid to determine peptide concentration by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce 23225). Peptides in 180 g portions from each sample were aliquoted and vacuum-dried. A reference sample was prepared by pooling the samples C3, NR1, NR3, and NR6. Each of 0.8 mg 11-plex TMT labelling reagents was reconstituted in 41 \\(\\upmu\\)l acetonitrile. The peptides were reconstituted in 36 \\(\\upmu\\)l of 0.1 M HEPES (pH 8.5) to prepare 5 mg/ml peptide solution and were mixed with 13.5 \\(\\upmu\\)l of the TMT reagent to label the peptides at room temperature for two hours. After the reaction, a 1 \\(\\upmu\\)l aliquot was taken from each sample to check TMT labelling efficiency by mass spectrometry. The reaction was quenched by adding 2.7 \\(\\upmu\\)l of 5% hydroxyline. The 11 samples in a TMT set were combined (2 mg total peptides) and desalted on SepPak C18 cartridges.\n\nPhosphopeptide enrichmentWe previously reported that engineered Src SH2 domains called the SH2 superbinder (SH2S) could be used to enrich pTyr peptides for mass spectrometry analysis[23]. SH2S-Agarose beads (Precision Proteomics, London, Canada) were used for pTyr peptide enrichment. Briefly, the TMT-labelled peptides were reconstituted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and incubated with 100 \\(\\upmu\\)l SH2S beads for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. The flow-through fraction was saved for pSer/Thr enrichment by Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)[24] (a gift from Dr. Mingliang Ye, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics). The beads were washed twice in 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate, followed by 2x washes in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The bound pTyr peptides were eluted using 0.4% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The eluted pTyr peptides were directly loaded onto the fractionation columns (see next section).\n\nThe flow-through fraction contains peptides not captured by the SH2S-agarose beads. Serine/threonine-phosphorylated peptides were enriched by Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-IMAC resin following a published protocol[24]. Briefly, a 500 \\(\\upmu\\)g portion of the flow-through fraction from the SH2S enrichment step was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 80% acetonitrile/6% TFA solution and then loaded to the IMAC resin. After incubation and wash steps (wash-1 solution: 50% acetonitrile, 6% TFA, 200 mM NaCl, wash-2 solution: 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA), the peptides were eluted by 10% ammonia, and dried by Speedvac.\n\nHigh-pH fractionationThe peptides were separated by Pierce high pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation kit (Thermo 84868). For proteome analysis, 10-\\(\\upmu\\)g portions of the peptides after TMT labelling were diluted in 300 \\(\\upmu\\)l 0.1% TFA for loading and 8 fractions (10-50% acetonitrile in 0.1% triethylamine) were collected. The IMAC-enriched peptides were resuspended in 300 \\(\\upmu\\)l 0.1% TFA and loaded onto the fractionation column. The SH2S-enriched peptides, upon elution in 0.4% TFA from the SH2S-agarose beads, were loaded directly to the fractionation column. For the IMAC and SH2S-enriched peptides, the peptides were eluted at 5, 10, 12.5, 15.0, 17.5, 20.0, 22.5 and 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% triethylamine in a step-wise manner and the resulting fractions (8) were concatenated into 4 tubes (i.e., combining fractions 1-5, 2-6, 3-7 and 4-8). The fractionated peptides were dried on Speedvac.\n\nLC-MS/MS experimentsThe fractionated peptides were reconstituted in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid (FA). The peptides were analyzed by the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) method on an EASY-nLC 1000 system coupled to a Q-Exactive Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were loaded on an Accalam PepMap 100 C18 column (20 mm with 75 \\(\\upmu\\)m in diameter, Thermo 164946), and separated on an EASY-Spray ES803A analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at the flow rate of 300 nl/min and a linear gradient from 3 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The gradient length was 2 hours for the pTyr phosphoproteome fractions and 4 h for the proteome or the IMAC phosphoproteome fractions. See Supplementary Table 3 for parameters of mass spectrometry data acquisition.\n\nMS data processingFragPipe version 16.0 was used for data processing[25]. For the proteome and IMAC datasets, the pool channel was used as the reference channel for batch correction. Due to the reporter ion interference from the phosphotyrosine boost channel (channel 1) to the pool channel (channel 3) caused by isotopic impurities of the TMT reagents, the pool channel was not usable for TMT batch correction for the SH2S-enriched pTyr datasets. Instead, the technical triplicate sample (the tonsl control C2 in all three TMT batches, see Supplementary Table 2) was used as the reference channels for batch correction. The human protein sequences obtained from Unit-Prot (20367 reviewed entries, February 2020) were used in the database search. For the proteome data processing, the TMT10-bridge workflow was used for the proteome search (by changing to the plex to TMT11). For the phosphoproteome data, the TMT10-phospho-bridge workflow was loaded, followed by changing the plex to TMT11 and the minimal peptide length to 6. The median centering normalization by FragPipe was applied to the log2 intensities.\n\n \n\n## ", "11 Results": "\n\nThe proteome and phosphoproteome are significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.\n\nThe 15 tumor samples used in the MS analysis included those from 8 patients that were tumor-free and 7 with recurring tumors. The 7 recurrent samples (R) contained 3 surgically resected primary tumors (R1-R3) with future recurrence and 4 secondary tumors collected from salvage surgery after relapse (R4-R7) (Supplementary Table 1). We also included 5 normal tonsil tissue samples (C) as controls in the MS analysis. The MS samples were divided randomly into three groups for tandem mass tag (TMT) labelling (Supplementary Table 2). Each batch of TMT-11plex also contained a mixture of peptides from the HNSCC patient-derived cell line 93VU147T and T cells (upon treatment with sodium per-vandate) in channel 1 to boost detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides [22], and a pool of tumor samples (in channel 3) for batch-to-batch normalization [33]. To facilitate phosphoproteomics analysis, we employed the Ti\\({}^{4+}\\)-IMAC beads to enrich pSer/pThr-containing peptides and the SH2 Superbinder (SH25) beads to capture pTyr-containing peptides prior to identification by nano liquid chromatography (nanoLC)-tandem MS (MS/MS) [23] (Supplementary Table 3). Collectively, our MS analysis identified 7288 proteins and 10,423 phosphosites, including 9253 pSer/pThr and 1170 pTyr sites (Fig. 1a) that were detected in at least 3 samples in both the patient and control groups. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest proteome and phosphoproteome datasets reported for HPV\\({}^{+}\\)-HNSCC to date.\n\nWe used uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the proteome data and determine whether the recurrent (R) and non-recurrent (NR) tumor groups could be distinguished. We found that the proteome was segregated according to recurrent status (Fig. 1b). Intriguingly, the primary tumors with future recurrence (R1-R3) were located between the recurrence-free primary tumors and the relapsed, secondary tumors on the UMAP plot. This suggests that the primary tumors with future recurrence acquired certain characteristics of the recurrent tumors prior to disease relapse.\n\nVolcano plots were used to identify the significantly altered proteins and phosphosites between groups, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to identify the associated biological processes and/or functions. Of the 307 proteins exhibiting significant changes with recurrence, 284 were found increased and 23 decreased in the recurrent group. The proteins with the greatest increases in the recurrent tumors included the neutrophil collagenase MMP-8, neutrophil detensin 3 (DEFA3), neutrophil elastase (ELANE), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), collagen, fibrinogens (FGG, FGB), and components of the complement system or of thrombosis (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table 4). In contrast, the most decreased proteins in the recurrent group included CD3y, CD8A, CD2, and CD6, which play essential roles in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and/or T cell interaction with other cells (Fig. 1c; Supplementary Table 5). This suggests that decreased T cell infiltration into the tumor is associated with the recurrence. GO analysis of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) further identified extracellular matrix (ECM) organization/regulation, neutrophil degranulation, and complement and coagulation as the most significantly upregulated processes/functions associated with recurrence (Fig. 1d). Comparison of the phosphoproteome data identified 157 significantly increased and 109 significantly decreased phosphosites in the recurrence relative to the no-recurrence group (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table 6). The phosphorylated proteins/phosphoites exhibiting the largest increases in the recurrence group included FGG-pY448, STAT5A/B-pY694/669, and SIT1-pY188. In contrast, MYH2-Y1381, CD8A-S231, CD247 (CD3Q)-Y111, CD3G-Y160, LCK-Y505, and VAV1-Y826 were among those displaying the largest decreases in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 1e; Supplementary Table 6). STAT5 phosphorylation (activation) is known to suppress anti-tumor immunity and promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion and survival [34]. SIT1 is a negative regulator whereas CD8A, CD3, LCK, VAV1 are positive regulators of TCR signaling. The significant differences in phosphorylation for these TCR regulators are consistent with T cell and TCR dysfunction in recurrent tumors. On the other hand, the increased phosphorylation of FGG is consistent with elevated fibrosis potential, cytoskeletal reorganization, and cell migration--GO processes that were found specifically enriched in the recurrence group (Fig. 1f). Collectively, the differential protein expression and phosphorylation analysis suggest that the recurrent tumors are characterized with an enriched ECM, an increased metastatic potential, and a decrease in T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response.\n\n### ", "Recurrence is driven by TME remodeling and increased EMT potential.": "\n\nBecause the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumor progression, we next analyzed the proteome using the knowledge-based functional gene expression signatures (Fges) that represent the major functional and cellular components of the tumor and TME [35]. Remarkable differences in specific Fges were found not only between the tumor and tonsil control groups, but also between the no-recurrence and recurrence groups (Fig. 2a). Of note, a significant reduction in the protein levels of CD8A, CD3G, CD3D, CD5, ZAP70, GZMA and GZMK, respectively, were detected in the recurrent group. Together with the results from the DEP analysis (Fig. 1e), this suggests that both the tumor-infiltrating and the effector function of cytotoxic (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)) T cells were compromised in the recurrent HNSCC. In contrast to T cell deficiency, the recurrent tumors were significantly enriched for markers of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs; eg., CD177, ELANE), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; eg., MRC1, CD68), and immune suppressive myeloid cells (MDSCs; eg., ARG1, CXCR). Although HPV-specific B cell responses have been associated with HPV\\({}^{+}\\)HNSCC [36], no significant change was detected for the B cell Fges between the recurrence and non-recurrence groups in our analysis beyond an overall reduction in B cell markers in the tumor compared to the tonsil control. In contrast, a moderate decrease in MHC-1 and MHC-II markers was observed in the recurrent group, suggesting that deficient antigen presentation is likely associated with recurrence. Collectively, these data indicate that the recurrent tumors possess an inflammatory and immune suppressive TME characterized with functional depletion of CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells and a marked increase in TANs, TAMs, and MDSCs.\n\nIn addition to the immune cells, the recurrent and non-recurrent tumors showed remarkable differences in the tumor stroma, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and ECM. A significant increase was observed for CAF markers, including PDGFR, FAP and collagens; ECM markers, including laminins, VTN (vitronectin), FN1 (fibronectin 1); and ECM remodeling metalloproteinases, including MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP7, and MMP9 (Fig. 2a). This suggests that the recurrent tumors are characterized with a rich and highly dynamic ECM, and thereby likely being more desmoplastic than the non-recurrent tumors. Moreover, we found a significant enrichment in the endothelium markers MMRN1 and MMRN2, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis potential. This, together with a pro-fibrotic and dynamic ECM, would contribute to increased metastasis for the recurrent tumors. Intriguingly, no significant difference was observed for the tumor proliferation markers MKi67, MCM2, and MCM6, suggesting that recurrence is driven primarily by TMEremodeling and the ensuing changes in the crosstalk between the tumor and TME, rather than by an increased proliferation potential of the tumor cells.\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process underlying cancer metastasis, which may play a role in recurrence[5]. To explore this link, we compared the protein levels of EMT regulators that were shown to mediate a partial EMT (pEMT) program associated with HNSCC lymph nodal metastasis in a recent single-cell transcriptomic study[28]. We found that the majority of the pEMT regulators were significantly increased in the recurrence group. These included the integrin \\(\\alpha\\) or \\(\\beta\\) chain proteins ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGB1 and ITGB6, the TGF-\\(\\beta\\) induced protein TGFBI, the serine protease inhibitor SERPINE1, the laminins LAMA3, LAMB3, and LAMC2, and the metalloproteinase MMP1, and the transcriptional MMP2 and MMP10, and thrombospondin 1 (THSP1) (Fig. 2b, c). In addition to the elevated pEMT program, a number of markers for hypoxia or stress response were found to be significantly different between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups, implying these processes in recurrence [5, 28] (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\n**Rewiring of the cellular signaling network in the recurrent tumors**. The significant enrichment in ECM and CAF functional markers suggests that the recurrent tumors are characterized with extracellular matrix deposition, remodeling, and crosslinking which together would drive fibrosis to stiffen the stroma and promote malignancy [37, 38]. We investigated this further by examining the ECM-integrin/receptor interaction network. Compared to the non-recurrent group, the recurrent group displayed a global and significant increase in essentially all ECM components, including collagen, laminin, fibronectin, transcin, vitronectin, and thrombospondin (THBS). A concomitant and significant increase in the corresponding receptors, including integrins and CD36, was also observed. Besides increased protein expression, the ECM-receptor network proteins were more highly phosphorylated in the recurrent tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 7). Together, these data suggest a remarkably extensive and active ECM-receptor interaction and signaling network in the recurrent tumor to promote cell-cell and ECM-tumor interactions, ECM remodeling, and fibrosis.\n\nBecause fibrosis plays a critical role in metastasis [39, 40, 30] which frequently accompanies recurrence, we compared the key regulators of fibrosis between the NR and R groups. We found that the collagens COL5A3 and COL12A1 and fibronectin 1 (FN1) were significantly increased in the R samples (Fig. 3). LOX12, which promotes crosslinking of ECM proteins [38], was also elevated, reinforcing our earlier observation that increased fibrosis potential and stiffness of the stroma are associated with recurrence. Nevertheless, MMP8, MMP9 and TIMP1, a metalloproteinase inhibitor [41], were found simultaneously increased with recurrence, suggesting that activity of the MMPs was dynamically regulated. Fibrosis is often a consequence of chronic inflammation [39, 38]. In agreement with this assertion, we found the inflammatory cytokine IL1-\\(\\beta\\) significantly increased in the recurrent group.\n\nComplement and coagulation were among the most significantly upregulated process associated with the recurrent tumors from our DEP analysis. Because the coagulation cascade is intimately associated with inflammation and fibrosis [42], we examined the complement system and coagulation cascade and found that numerous components of this cascade were indeed increased in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 4a). Notably, the blood coagulation initiation factors F3 and F12, the coagulation factor F10, prothrombin (F2) and the fibrinogen subunits FGA, FGB and FGG were all significantly increased in the recurrent tumors, suggesting that both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are activated [43]. Similarly, numerous proteins of the complement system, including C2, C3, C5 and CFI (FI), were increased in the R group (Fig. 4b), implicating inflammatory response mediated by the complement system in HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC recurrence [44]. These data suggest ECM remodeling, activation of the coagulation, and fibrin formation/fibrinolysis play an important role in remodeling the TME to facilitate HNSCC recurrence.\n\nIn contrast to the upregulation of the ECM and coagulation and complement signaling network, the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathway was significantly suppressed in the recurrent tumors. Specifically, numerous proteins involved in TCR proximal signaling, including CD3y, CD3z, LCK, and CD45, the key phosphatase for LCK activation, and CD48, a receptor involved in T cell activation, were all significantly decreased in expression and/or phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2b, Supplementary Data 1). Similarly, a number of TCR downstream signaling regulators or effectors, including VAV1, PKC0, NFAT, P38, and Erk, were down-regulated. These observations, which suggest defective TCR signaling, reinforce our previous observation that the recurrent tumors were defective in T cell function. Besides the TCR signaling pathway, numerous proteins of the spliceosome were seen down-regulated in the recurrent tumor, implicating defective RNA splicing in recurrence (Supplementary Fig. 3). In this regard, alternative splicing has been shown to play an important role in tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [45].\n\n**Kinome reprogramming associated with recurrence**. Protein kinases play a critical role in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis, which has provided a basis for kinase-targeted therapy in the treatment of numerous cancers. In fact, \\(>\\)90% of HNSCC is characterized with overexpression of the EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (TK) [5, 46]. To find out if EGFR or other TFs and STKs (Ser/Thr kinases) are involved in HNSCC recurrence, we compared the kinase expression and phosphorylation levels between the recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Indeed, numerous kinases exhibited significant differences between the R and NR groups (Fig. 5a, b). Specifically, the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR, PDGFRB, MST1R, and PTK7 were found significantly increased in expression in the recurrent tumors (Fig. 5a, b). PDGFRB plays a critical role in CAF proliferation while DDR1 is a collagen receptor [47]. Together these two RTKs may play an important role in regulating fibrosis [47, 48]. The macrophage-stimulating protein receptor MST1R (or RON), which regulates the migration and activation of macrophages and activates wound-healing responses [49], may play the dual role of promoting TAM and MDSC recruitment and fibrosis. The protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7) has been recently shown to mediate the crosstalk between the tumor cells and CAFs and to promote cancer stemness in head and neck cancer [50]. Its upregulation in recurrent tumors suggests that increased cancer stemness is associated with recurrence. In addition to the RTKs, the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (CTKs) YES1, which may be recruited to activated EGFR and PDGFRB, was also significantly upregulated in the R group. YES1 activation may be corroborated by decreased CSK, a negative regulator of the Src family kinases.\n\nFig. 1: The proteome and phosphoproteome are distinct between non-recurrent and recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC.

Moreover, numerous STKs exhibited elevated (Fig. 5c) or reduced (Supplementary Fig. 4) phosphorylation in the recurrent tumors. The over-phosphorylated STKs included those that regulate cell proliferation and survival (eg., MAP2K2, MAPKK5, MAPK9, PRKD1, BRAF, AKT2, TTK, and WNK1), cytoskeletal reorganization/cell migration (eg., MYLK,\n\nFig. 4: **The coagulation process and complement system are up-regulated in recurrent HNSCC.****a** The complement and coagulation cascades showing overexpression (red marked) of key pathway components in the recurrent samples.

The phosphorylation levels of these proteins were also significantly reduced in the recurrent tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4). Furthermore, a significant decrease in phosphorylation was observed for the TCR and BCR (B cell receptor) proximal kinases LCK and SYK at their respective activation loop Tyr sites, indicating, once again, decreased T/B cell function in the recurrent tumors.\n\nCollectively, these data suggest that a broad reprogramming of the kinome at both the protein and phosphorylation level underlies recurrence. Importantly, the reprogrammed TFs/STKs form an extensive protein-protein interaction and signaling network that regulate the multiple processes that are altered in the recurrent tumors, including cytoskeletal reorganization, cell adhesion, ECM remodeling, EMT, neutrophil function and coagulation/thrombosis (Fig. 5d).\n\n**Predictive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for recurrent HNSCC.** Besides generating mechanistic insights, a major motivation of this study is to identify predictive biomarkers for patient stratification and novel therapeutic targets. Of the hundreds of differentially expressed and/or differentially phosphorylated proteins, many are potential therapeutic targets based on the DrugBank, a database of FDA-approved therapeutic targets [53]. The list of therapeutic targets identified herein contained not only protein kinases such as PDGFR, EGFR, MAP2K2, PDKCD, and JUN, but also regulators of fibrosis, coagulation/ complement systems, neutrophil function, and inflammation, including MMP9, fibrinogens, PROS1, C5, C3, ELANE, FCGR3A and IL1B (Fig. 6a, b). MMP9, which tops the list of candidate therapeutic targets, plays an essential role in local ECM degradation, leukocyte migration and EMT. Because aberrant regulation of these processes underlies recurrence of HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC, targeting MMP9 and its regulators may be a plausible approach by which to curb recurrence [54]. In this regard, the expression of MMP9 is found to be controlled by an elaborate PPI network that include the upstream regulators EGFR, PTK2, MAPK5, IGFBP7, IL1B, STAT5A, FOS/JUN, and CCL5 (Fig. 6c). While EGFR, PTK2 (FAK) and MAPK9 may directly regulate FOS, the cytokine IL1B [54] may regulate JUN directly or indirectly via CCL5 which also plays a critical role in monocyte recruitment and TAM infiltration within tumors [55, 56]. Therefore, targeting these regulators, especially when in combination, provides an alternative means to targeting MMP9.\n\nPersonalized treatment of HNSCC based on recurrence potential would greatly enhance the efficacy of treatment for the recurrent cases and reduce morbidity of patients with non-recurrent cancer. Towards this goal, we next aimed at identifying predictive biomarkers of recurrence, by investigating a correlation between our proteomic observations and clinical samples from other cohorts. Because a database for HNSCC recurrence is unavailable, we resorted to predict patient survival using the TCGA HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC database [57] (\\(n=71\\)). A predictive marker was chosen when the following three conditions were met: (1) the protein abundance was significantly different between the NR and R groups, (2) the protein is an FDA-approved drug target (Fig. 6a, b), and (3) the expression of the marker is significantly correlated with patient survival. Our analysis identified eight potential biomarkers of HNSCC recurrence, namely PROS1, ANXA3, COL2A1, F3, TUBB3, PSMB5, SLC/A11/xCT, and CD2 (Fig. 7a). Most of these proteins are involved in the identified fibrosis or coagulation pathways/PPI networks associated with recurrence (Figs. 3, 4). The SLC/A11/xCT pSer26 site is a substrate of the kinase complex mTOR2 [58], whose activation has been implicated in HNSCC disease progression [59]. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that reduced expression of any of these markers, except for CD2, was significantly associated with improved disease-specific survival. In contrast, a high expression level of the T cell marker CD2 was correlated with better outcome (Fig. 7b).\n\nFootnote 2: https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-022-0059-8\n\n## ", "Discussion": "\n\nOur comparative proteomic and phosphoproteomics analysis of recurrent and non-recurrent tumors indicate the tumor micro-environment (TME) plays an essential role in HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC recurrence. The TME comprises immune cells, blood vessels, and the stroma, including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the extracellular matrix [60]. We found that the recurrent tumors differ significantly from the non-recurrent tumors in these hallmark features. First, the recurrent tumors are characterized with an inflammatory and suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) [61], characterized with increased TANs and TAMs, decreased antigen presentation, and deficient T/B cell function [62]. This suggests that the immune evasion by the recurrent tumor is mediated by the lymphoid and myeloid cells [63]. The enrichment of TANs is consistent with a recent observation that later stage oral squamous cell carcinoma patients have elevated plasma neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [64]. This also provides an explanation for hypercoagulability, a major cancer-associated complication linked to poor patient prognosis, observed in the recurrent samples. Second, we found a remarkable and significant increase in CAFs in the recurrent group, suggesting fibrosis or a prolvity for fibrosis underlies recurrence. The CAFs are not only major contributors of cancer fibrosis through increased collagen crosslinking, but they may also promote tumorigenesis through the collagen-integrin and collagen-RTX signaling networks. In the same vein, the role of CAFs in promoting EMT has been observed in multiple cancer types [65]. Third, the TME is enriched in ECM and ECM remodeling proteins. ECM deposition, remodeling and crosslinking can drive fibrosis to stiff the stroma, which, in turn, enhance tumor progression, aggression, angiogenesis, and hypoxia [76, 37]. Matrix-rich, fibrotic tumors are also associated with poor immunity characterized with poor T cell penetration and activation. Finally, the crosstalk between the tumor cells, CAFs, immune cells and ECM may promote tumor progression, tumor cell intravasation and metastasis, leading to cancer relapse [77, 38, 36]. Indeed, we found that the recurrent tumors were enriched in genes mediating a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal (pEMT) program, reminiscent of the finding from a recent single cell RNA analysis of matched primary and lymph node metastasis HNSCC (mainly the HPV\\({}^{-}\\) subtype) [28]. This suggests that an increased EMT potential is associated with HNSCC recurrence in general regardless of the HPV infection status.\n\nTME remodeling is likely driven by the corresponding changes in the underlying signaling pathways and/or protein-protein interaction networks. That essentially all components of the ECM-integrin signaling network are significantly over-expressed and hyper-phosphorylated suggest ECM dynamics and remodeling are cardinal features of HNSCC recurrence. The involvement of the coagulation/thrombosis pathway and the\n\nFigure 5: **Fione reprogramming in the recurrent tumor.**a) Heatmap of protein kinases with significantly increased or decreased expression in the recurrent tumors (>2-fold difference and \\(p<0.1\\) between the NR and R groups).

In this regard, it would be of interest to confirm this assertion by proteomic analysis of an HPV- HNSCC cohort. Depletion of T cells has been associated with recurrent HNSCC, and our study suggests that both tumor infiltration and function of CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells are compromised in the HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. A recent study has identified the spliceosome pathway as a key cellular function elevated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma[68]. However, our proteomic data suggests that the RNA splicing pathway is compromised in the recurrent HNSCC.\n\nBecause EGFR is overexpressed in 80-90% HNSCC, we investigated the role of protein kinases and kinase signaling in recurrence. Indeed, we have identified significant changes in the expression and/or phosphorylation of numerous TFs and STKs,\n\nFig. 6: **Candidate therapeutic targets for precision treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\)HNSCC.** A Heatmap showing overexpression of a list of FDA-approved therapeutic targets in the recurrent tumors.

Of note, an altered kinase signaling network involving EGFR, PDGFR, PAKI, PTK2 (FAK), PRKCD, and MAPK2 appear to regulate the aberrant changes in the cancer cells and the TME accompanying recurrence.\n\nOur investigation into the mechanism of HNSCC recurrence led to the discovery of numerous potential therapeutic targets. Some targets, including EGFR, PDGFR, FAK, CXCR4, and MMP9, have corresponding inhibitors that have been approved or are under active clinical trials for cancer treatment. Our study suggests that these inhibitors may be repurposed for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. Although the EGFR antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV\\({}^{-}\\) HNSCC where cytotoxic chemotherapy is not the best\n\nFig. 7: **Potential biomarkers for predicting recurrence and survival.** a Box plots of representative biomarkers emerging from this study. \\(P\\) values shown were based on Student\u2019s t-test.

For each gene, the 71 patients were divided into high expression (_n_ = 36) or low expression (_n_ = 35) group, and the disease-specific survival months were plotted. The dotted lines show 95% confidence intervals.\n\n option due to comorbidities, our data suggests that cetuximab in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used to preempt or treat recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. In the same vein, FDA-approved PDGFR inhibitors may be used in the above combination therapies owing to its critical role in promoting tumorigenesis and fibrosis. Because both EGFR and PDGFR signal through MAP2K2 (MEK2), the latter of which is significantly activated in the recurrent tumors, pharmacological blockade of MAP2K2 activity may be an alternative approach for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC. Furthermore, our work led to the identification of \\(>\\)30 potential FDA-approved therapeutic targets for exploration and validation [53].\n\nCheckpoint blockade immunotherapies benefit only 20-30% of HNSCC patients [61]. This moderate rate of response demands for better understanding of the immune landscape of HNSCC. The recurrent tumors may be more resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as collagen can promote anti-PD-1/PD-L1 resistance via CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cell exhaustion [69]. Reducing collagen deposition by inhibiting LOXL2, which promotes crosslinking of ECM proteins and is significantly upregulated in the recurrent HNSCC, maybe a potential approach to activate the exhausted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T cells in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy as demonstrated recently for lung cancer in a mouse model [69]. In this regard, it is worth noting that an LOXL2 blocking antibody is currently in preclinical and clinical fibrosis trials [66]. Other CAF-targeting drugs that are currently under clinical trials may also be repurposed for the treatment of recurrent HNSCC, including inhibitors of FAK (PTK2), ROCK, and CXCR which we have found to be significantly overexpressed and/or hyper-activated in the recurrent tumors. While FAK and ROCK are key regulators of the cytoskeleton, CXCR4 is expressed by monocytes or monocytic MDSCs [55]. Therefore, the TME provides a wealth of potential therapeutic targets for future exploration. Our work further suggests that, apart from targeting exhausted T cells, the myeloid cell population affords an attractive immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of recurrent HPV\\({}^{+}\\) HNSCC.\n\nOur recurrent tumor samples contained both primary tumors with future recurrence and resected tissues from relapsed tumors. That the proteome and phosphoproteome of these two sets of samples converge on the key features identified herein suggest that it is possible to predict recurrence using the primary tumor biopsy prior to disease relapse. In support of this, several proteins identified to play an important role in recurrence are capable of predicting patient survival using an independent TCGA HNSCC cohort. These potential biomarkers, including PROS1, ANX3, F3, COL2A1, TUBB3, PSM5B5, SLC7A11/xCT and CD2, are key regulators of fibrosis, coagulation, metastasis, or immune responses. PROS1 and F3 are particularly attractive biomarkers because they are secreted proteins. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined if these proteins are also elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with recurrent disease.\n\nA key limitation of our study is the modest sample size. Despite this, our proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis has identified a number of TME features associated with recurrence. Our study highlights the need to conduct deep and quantitative proteomic analysis independently or in combination with transcriptomic profiling to better understand the systems basis of cancer recurrence and/or metastasis to inform prognosis and treatment of recurrent/metastatic cancers.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nSource data for the figures are provided as Supplementary Data 2, 3.

Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) represent a significant and pervasive issue within the healthcare domain. Healthcare professionals, including nurses, physicians, and allied health workers, are particularly susceptible to MSDs due to the physically demanding nature of their work. Tasks such as patient handling, repetitive motions, and prolonged standing or sitting periods can strain the musculoskeletal system considerably [1]. As a result, healthcare workers often experience joint pain, back injuries, and other related conditions [2-4]. In such situations, healthcare professionals face the challenge of providing care to others while avoiding personal injury during their daily tasks [5].\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders encompass various signs and symptoms affecting various parts of the musculoskeletal system. These disorders can manifest as pain, swelling/redness, stiffness, and weakness/loss of function. They impact muscles, joints, tendons, nerves, and other structures throughout the body [6].\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified musculoskeletal disorders as the primary cause of disability and limitations in daily life and work-related activities. These disorders can lead to decreased productivity and income loss due to work absences or career-ending accidents [7]. Specific occupational activities are associated with different types of musculoskeletal disorders. Healthcare workers, given the ergonomic risk factors inherent to their professions, are particularly vulnerable to such conditions [1,8,9].\n\nIn a cross-sectional study, researchers investigated a cohort of 645 registered nurses from four regions in China. The findings were quite remarkable, as they showed an overall 12-month prevalence rate of MSDs at 84.2%, with the most frequently affected areas being the lower back (73.5%), neck (73.2%), and shoulders (66.2%). To better understand the factors contributing to MSDs in different body parts, the study utilized logistic regression analysis, considering various potential risk factors. Interestingly, this analysis highlighted the significance of individual factors such as the number of hours worked per week, gender, body mass index (BMI), age, and alcohol consumption, all of which were found to substantially impact the likelihood of experiencing MSDs [4].\n\nAccording to a study conducted in Tunisia in 2021 among a population of midwives, most surveyed midwives were overweight, with an average body mass index (BMI) of 28.3 kg/m\\({}^{2}\\) + 3.9. The average length of work experience as a midwite was 20.2 + 9.1 years, with a maximum of 38 years and a minimum of 3 years. During the past 12 months, the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders affecting the neck and shoulder was 90.7%. Complaints were predominantly located in the neck and shoulder region, reported by 72.7% of the cases, followed by the shoulders at 64.8%. In this study, obesity and a history of musculoskeletal trauma were significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders affecting the neck and shoulder. However, no socio-professional risk factors were associated with among midwives in the past 12 months [10].\n\nSimilarly, Shaikh et al., 2021 [7], conducted a study to examine work-related musculoskeletal disorders among nurses at the Gulf Medical College Hospital and Research Center. The prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders among nursing staff was approximately 40%, with over 50% being at risk of developing these disorders. The musculoskeletal disorders primarily occurred in the lower back (29.0%), ankle (20.0%), shoulders (14.8%), and knees (13.3%).\n\nIn the Moroccan context, according to a study conducted by Lghabi et al. [11] at Ibn Rochd University Hospital in Morocco, all of the surveyed healthcare personnel (12 doctors and 8 nurses) experienced spinal pain, 40% reported pain in the shoulder and elbow, and 80% reported pain in the wrists. Most personnel (95%) were over 40 years old, and 40%primarily worked in a standing position. Additionally, 80% reported significant fatigue and dissatisfaction with their work positions.\n\nHealthcare is a highly context-dependent profession. While existing studies in other countries offer valuable insights into the issue, they may not capture the specific challenges and risk factors that Moroccan healthcare professionals face. In Morocco, the combination of cultural, organizational, and policy factors within the healthcare system can significantly influence the prevalence and impact of musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) among healthcare workers. The challenging physical requirements of the job, combined with insufficient human resources and the stress stemming from the limited availability of medical equipment, specialized tools(lifting equipment), ergonomic assistance, training, and robust safety measures, can significantly influence healthcare workers' susceptibility to MSD [12].\n\nMoroccan public hospitals suffer, in fact, from a series of dysfunctions and shortcomings that have perverse effects on the quality of their practices, activities, and services. These include resource shortages, ineffective resource management, governance challenges, staff demorization, accessibility issues, and user dissatisfaction [13]. Despite absorbing a significant portion, approximately 70 to 80%, of the health sector's budget, many public hospitals grapple with inadequate infrastructure, including deteriorating technical facilities and buildings [14]. Furthermore, these institutions often operate with insufficient staffing and limited equipment. The shortage of healthcare personnel in the Moroccan healthcare system is evident, and the unequal distribution across regions exacerbates the issue. In 2012, the World Health Organization identified Morocco as one of the 57 countries facing a chronic deficit of medical staff [15]. This crisis often forces professionals into tasks outside their usual job scope. For instance, due to a shortage of orderlies, doctors may be required to personally transport patients to examination rooms. Frequently criticized and sometimes regarded as unavoidable, this situation is consistently mentioned as a symptom of the crisis affecting all professions [15]. This shortage can lead to heightened pressure on existing staff, resulting in increased stress levels and a greater susceptibility to Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs).\n\nFurthermore, previous literature indicated that the progress in ergonomics in Industrially Advanced Countries (IACs) over the last decades is praiseworthy. Yet, it also highlights the significant lack of ergonomics in areas known as industrialized developing countries (IDCs). This deficiency is also noticeable within the healthcare industry [16].\n\nMeasuring the prevalence of MSD among healthcare professionals working in such particular conditions of a developing country as Morocco is essential. This study stands out by focusing on the Moroccan healthcare context, aiming to offer insights that address the unique challenges healthcare workers face in Morocco. Accordingly, this study aims to determine the 12-month prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and identify the factors associated with these disorders among health practitioners at the provincial hospital center of Ouarzazate.\n\n**METHODs**\n\n_Study design_\n\nThis cross-sectional quantitative study determined the prevalence and factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders among nursing staff at the Provincial Hospital Center in Ouarzazate. This study took place in the various departments of the Provincial Hospital Center in Ouarzazate. It was conducted between February and June 2022.\n\n_Study population and sampling_\n\nThe target population of this study includes health professionals from all specialties working in the various departments of the Provincial Hospital Center in Ouarzazate. The exhaustive sampling approach was employed in this study, encompassing all health professionals practicing in every hospital department (nurses, midwives, technicians, and physiotherapists). The total population size included in the study was N = 200.\n\nFor this study's specific aims, we intentionally focused exclusively on healthcare professionals who share a common educational background from the same institute and exhibit similar work patterns and roles (nurses, midwives, technicians, and physiotherapists). This deliberate choice was made to yield more focused and easily interpretable data. As a result, this study includes professionals from all specialties practicing during the data collection period and willingly agreeing to participate. This study excludes doctors, professionals on leave, health professionals absent during the data collection period, and individuals who declined to participate.\n\n_Data collection and instruments_\n\nTo collect data for our study, we prepared a questionnaire that covers various sections to gather sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and medical data. A French version of the Nordic questionnaire, consisting of 28 items, was utilized to identify the specific locations of disorders within the last 12 months. The Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) was chosen for its proven validity and reliability in evaluating musculoskeletal symptoms [17, 18] and its user-friendly nature for easy administration and completion.\n\nWe identified and enlisted participants for our study within the institution through a conventional method involving physically distributing questionnaires using paper and pen. Before commencing the data collection process, we obtained validation from an occupational physician regarding the questionnaire's form and content. This step indicates that we ensured the questionnaire was well-designed and relevant to the specific occupational health context being studied. Furthermore, we conducted a preliminary test involving the distribution of 22 questionnaires to healthcare professionals at a healthcare facility in Ouarzazate. This step ensured the confirmation of question clarity, simplicity, and understanding.\n\n_Data analysis_\n\nThe data analysis used SPSS version 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. For the association between variables, the chi-square test was applied. The statistical significance level was set at P <0.05.\n\n_Ethical considerations_\n\nBefore initiating the research, the study received approval from the Higher Institute of Nursing Professions and Health Techniques, and administrative permission was obtained from the hospital administration. Before data collection, the following ethical principles were observed and communicated to the participants: (a) providing a clear explanation of the study's objectives to the participating students; (b) ensuring the anonymity of the participants; (c) obtaining their informed consent; and (d) safeguarding the confidentiality of the collected data.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n_Sociodemographic profile of the study population_\n\nThe questionnaire was distributed to 200 healthcare professionals, 120 of whom agreed to participate in the study, giving a response rate of 60%. The target population is characterized by a predominance of females at a rate of 66.7% and a dominance of young age (less than 30 years) at a rate of 51.7%. 41.7% of the population are general nurses, and 66.67% have a 1 to 10-year seniority. The participants work in various departments or units, with the highest representation in the intensive care unit (14.2%). A small percentage of participants have chronic diseases (10.8%), medical history (10.8%), or surgical history (14.2%). In terms of commitment, 30% of participants engage in sports. As for BMI, most of our population had a BMI between 18.5 and 25 (56.7%).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c} \\hline \\hline  & **N** & **Percentage** \\\\ \\hline Sex & & \\\\ Male & & \\\\ Female & & \\\\ Age (years) & & \\\\ \\(<\\)31 years & & \\\\ \\(>\\)31 years & & \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Sample characteristics.\n\n _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH (International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health)_\n\nhttps://ampphaethiquural-network.org\n\nSpeciality\n\nGeneral Nurse\n\n Nurse in Anesthesia and Intensive Care.\n\n Midwife\n\n Medical X-ray technician\n\n Emergency and intensive care nurse\n\n Mental health nurse\n\n Neonatology and pediatrics nurse\n\n Laboratory medical analysis technician\n\n Physiotherapist\n\n Seniority\n\n \\(<\\) 10 years\n\n \\(>\\) 10 years\n\n Department/unit\n\n General medicine unit\n\n General surgery unit\n\n Intensive care unit\n\n Emergency\n\n Psychiatry department\n\n Postpartum care unit\n\n Maternity\n\n Operating room\n\n Hemodialysis unit\n\n Pediatric surgery unit\n\n Pediatric unit\n\n Center of Blood Transfusion\n\n Radiology department\n\n 7\n\n Laboratory _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH (International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health)_\n\nhttps://ampphealthjournal-network.org\n\nRehabilitation unit\n\nChronic disease\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nMedical history\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNon-Professional engagements\n\nSport\n\nFamily\n\n14\n\n11.7%\n\nExtra work\n\n7\n\n5.8%\n\nNo\n\nBody Mass Index\n\nNormal\n\n68\n\n56.7%\n\nNon-normal\n\n52\n\n43.3%\n\n_Prevalence of MSDs and associated factors_\n\nThe general prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) is 89.2%. The lower back is the most frequently experienced site of pain by nursing personnel, accounting for 63.3% over the past 12 months.\n\nFigure 1: Locations of musculoskeletal disorders among the participants during the last 12 months.\n\n _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH_ (_International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health_)\n\nhttps://ampphhealthjournal-network.org\n\nThe prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is higher in females (\\(95.0\\%\\)) than in males (\\(77.5\\%\\)). According to the Chi-square statistical test results, this difference between the two genders is statistically significant (p-value = 0.009). According to our results, individuals in the age group of less than 31 years have a high prevalence percentage of musculoskeletal disorders (\\(98.4\\%\\)) with a p-value \\(>001\\), indicating a high statistical significance. There is no observed statistical relationship between an individual's medical and surgical background and the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs).\n\nAccording to the participants' BMI (Body Mass Index), the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders revealed that individuals with abnormal BMI (obesity and underweight) have a higher percentage of musculoskeletal disorder prevalence of \\(94.1\\%\\). On the other hand, individuals with an average weight represent a percentage of \\(80.7\\%\\).\n\nIt was observed that the prevalence is high among midwives (\\(93.8\\%\\)), followed by physiotherapists (\\(87.5\\%\\)) and general nurses with a percentage of \\(84\\%\\). Additionally, the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is high among individuals with less than 10 years of experience (\\(96.2\\%\\)). The Chi-square statistical test analysis demonstrates that the relationship between prevalence and experience is statistically significant (p-value = 0.001).\n\nWhen it comes to the working system, health professionals who work in the shift work system are the most affected by musculoskeletal disorders (\\(92\\%\\)). Moreover, professionals in roles within the general medicine unit, postpartum care unit, laboratory, and radiology unit exhibit the highest prevalence of MSDs (\\(100\\%\\)). Conversely, professionals in the Pediatric unit experience the lowest prevalence of such disorders (\\(66.7\\%\\)).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline \\hline  & & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Prevalence**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**P value**} \\\\ \\cline{3-5}  & & N & (\\%) & \\\\ Sex & & & & \\\\  & Female & 76 & 95.0\\% & \\\\  & Male & 31 & 77.5\\% & \\\\ Age (year) & & & & \\\\  & \\(<\\)31 years & 60 & 96.8\\% & \\\\  & \\(>\\)31 years & 46 & 79.3\\% & \\\\ Medical history & Yes & 12 & 92.3\\% & \\\\  & No & 95 & 88.8\\% & \\\\ Surgical history & & & & \\\\  & Yes & 16 & 94.1\\% & \\\\  & No & 91 & 88.3\\% & \\\\ BMI & & & & \\\\  & Normal & 43 & 80.7\\% & \\\\  & Non-normal & 64 & 94.1\\% & \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Self-reported prevalence of MSDs according to the personal characteristics of the participants.\n\n Musculoskeletal disorders in the lower back are more prevalent among females, accounting for 68.8% compared to 52.5% in males. However, this difference between genders is not statistically significant, as indicated by a p-value of 0.1. Among individuals below the age of 31, 30,71% experience lower back pain, but this disparity in prevalence across age groups is also not statistically significant (p-value = 0.08). On the other hand, there is a significant association between reported low back\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \\hline \\hline  & & **Prevalence** & **P value** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{4}{*}{Speciality} & \\multirow{4}{*}{General Nurse} & \\multirow{4}{*}{42} & \\multirow{4}{*}{84\\%} \\\\  & & & \\\\  & & pain prevalence and seniority/experience. It is more common among individuals with a seniority/experience of less than 10 years. This difference is statistically significant (P= 0.003).\n\nAmong various departments, the highest prevalence of lower back pain is observed among professionals working in the maternity department (87.5%), followed by the radiology unit (85.7%) and the Intensive Care Unit (82.4%). However, the difference in prevalence between these departments is not statistically significant, as indicated by a p-value of 0.7. Additionally, individuals working with a shift work system have a high prevalence of lower back pain, with 68% reporting the condition. However, the association between lower back pain prevalence and shift work system is not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.3.\n\n**DISCussion**\n\nThe prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the target population over the past 12 months is alarming, as the majority of them (89.2%) are affected, with a high percentage among women (95%). This difference between the two genders is statistically significant (p-value = 0.009). These findings are consistent with similar studies by Krishnan et al. [19] and Thanh Hai Nguyen [20]. Additionally, most studies indicate that women are significantly more prone to developing MSDs compared to men [19, 21].\n\nThe lower back is the most commonly affected area (63.3%), followed by the neck with a percentage of 54.20%. These results are consistent with a study conducted in Tunisia, which also found that musculoskeletal problems primarily developed in the lower back (68.5%). They also align with a meta-analysis conducted by Clari et al, involving 3590 nurses [22], where the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) was observed in the lower back (62%; 95% of the sample). Similarly, a study conducted in China found that the most frequently affected areas among nurses were the lower back (73.5%), followed by the neck (73.2%) [4].\n\nAge was a factor influencing the prevalence of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs). Young participants (< 31 years) were the most affected group. This difference in prevalence based on age can possibly be explained, among other factors, by a lack of experience among younger healthcare professionals in the field. On the one hand, younger professionals in the early stages of their careers may still be learning and adapting to the physical demands of their profession. They may also be more prone to additional workload or overtime shifts due to their eagerness to gain experience or prove themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, participants who have been working in the field for longer are more likely to have developed better techniques and strategies to minimize the risk of developing MSDs. They may have learned how to position their bodies correctly, use ergonomic equipment, and adopt appropriate work postures that reduce strain on their muscles and joints. However, these findings' potential presence of survival bias should be acknowledged. Healthcare professionals experiencing MSDs may leave their jobs prematurely, especially before reaching an older age. Consequently, the actual risk for older individuals in these findings might be underestimated. Moreover, these findings do not align with those mentioned in other studies that have indicated a higher prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders with increasing age [7, 19, 21].\n\nThe presence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among the health professionals in our study was significantly associated with years of experience in the profession. According to our results, healthcare professionals with less than 10 years of experience were most susceptible to MSDs (p=0.001). These findings align with a study by Long et al (2021) [23], which reported similar results. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential presence of survival bias in these findings. Suppose individuals at a greater risk of MSDs tend to exit the profession prematurely. In that case, the study's sample may be skewed toward longer-tenured healthcare practitioners who have remained in the field for extended periods. This bias may artificially portray the more experienced group as having a lower MSD risk while potentially underestimating the true risk among less experienced practitioners who may leave due to MSDs or other factors. To address this bias in future research, longitudinal studies tracking individuals from the start of their careers, focusing on reasons for leaving the profession, could provide more accurate insights into the association between experience and MSD risk while accounting for potential attrition due to health issues. Additionally, conducting subgroup analyses for different healthcare specialties and considering changing workplace conditions over time could further enhance the understanding of this association.\n\nFurthermore, individuals with abnormal body mass index (BMI) had the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) at 94.1%. On the other hand, individuals with normal weight represented the majority, with a prevalence rate of 80.8%. These findings are consistent with existing literature, which indicates that excess weight is recognized as a risk factor for MSDs, particularly in the lower limbs [19]. However, in our study, The association between BMI values and the prevalence of MSDs was not significant (p=0.07).\n\nAmong the individuals included in the study, midwives exhibited the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) at 93.8%. This was closely followed by physiotherapists, with a prevalence of 87.5%, and general nurses, with a prevalence rate of 84%. Numerous studies have investigated the occurrence of MSDs among midwives and have consistently shown significant prevalence rates [24-26].\n\nWe also found that the variables type of work unit, work system, and medical and surgical history did not significantly increase the risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders. However, another study conducted by Bejia et al., 2005 [27], reported a significant relationship between all these factors and the prevalence of MSDs.\n\nThe factors associated with the self-reported prevalence of lower back pain, as the most frequently affected region, were examined in our study. The prevalence of lower back pain did not show a significant association with the sex and age of the participants. This result is consistent with a meta-analysis by Clari et al. [22], which demonstrated that gender was not among the significant predictive factors for lower back disorders. Furthermore, our findings revealed a significant association between the number of years of experience and the prevalence of low back pain (p=0.003). These findings align with prior studies suggesting that years of professional experience are linked to low back pain [11,28,29].\n\nRegarding the work schedule, 68% of individuals experiencing lower back pain worked in a shift system. However, there was no significant relationship between the work system and the prevalence of low back disorders. The relationship between these variables was statistically significant in a study conducted by Chen et al [30].\n\nHealthcare workers perform many patient-handling tasks throughout their demanding workdays, subjecting them to a significant risk of experiencing widespread lower back discomfort. This prevalent issue arises from the repetitive tasks in patient care, often involving lifting, transferring, and positioning patients. These repetitive movements strain the lower back considerably, increasing the likelihood of discomfort and pain. Furthermore, the abnormal development and activation of the multifidus muscle, a key stabilizing muscle in the lumbar region, can compound the problem. Inadequate activation or muscle imbalances in the multifidus can compromise spinal support, exacerbating the risk of low back pain among healthcare professionals [31].\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that there may be variations in findings across studies on musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare workers due to differences in working conditions, workload, and various other factors. The nature of healthcare work is multifaceted, and factors such as patient population, healthcare settings, and individual characteristics can contribute to variations in the prevalence and risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders. Therefore, it is essential to consider the specific context of each study when interpreting and comparing results.\n\nThe prevalence of Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) among healthcare workers in Morocco can be interpreted in the context of the challenging healthcare conditions within the country. The healthcare offering encompasses a coherent combination of human resources, healthcare infrastructure, and a material and technical platform to provide care services that meet the population's health needs. However, the shortage of resources in the Morocco Ministry of Health makes it challenging to maintain the quality of services, leading to suffering among the working population [12]. Despite significant progress in recent years, the Moroccan healthcare system grapples with numerous obstacles. One crucial challenge is the unequal distribution of healthcare resources; this inequality extends to healthcare infrastructure, medical equipment, and specialist care, creating disparities that impact healthcare delivery [32].\n\n _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH (International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health)_\n\nhttps://ampphhealthjournal-network.org\n\nMoroccan public hospitals, which shoulder a substantial portion of the healthcare burden, face persistent challenges and dysfunctions. These institutions operate under tremendous pressure due to the rising demand for healthcare services while dealing with a shortage of human resources. The shortage and inefficient management of resources, staff demotivation, deteriorating working conditions, and accessibility difficulties, particularly in remote areas, are some of the dysfunctions plaguing public hospitals in Morocco. The complexity of hospital organization, variability in care processes and flows, diversification of specialties, the complexity of healthcare technologies, and the diversity of cases arriving at the hospital compound the issues these hospitals face [12, 33].\n\nThe Moroccan province of Ouarzazate, situated in the heart of the Kingdom, is home to 350,000 residents. According to the Moroccan Ministry of Health, it is designated as a region facing challenges regarding the availability of healthcare personnel [34]. In this challenging healthcare environment, healthcare workers in Morocco are more susceptible to MSD due to the physical demands of their profession, the lack of adequate resources, and the strain caused by inadequate working conditions. Understanding the intersection of healthcare conditions and the prevalence of MSDs among healthcare professionals in Morocco is essential for developing targeted interventions and improving the overall quality of healthcare services in the country.\n\nFurther research is needed to comprehensively understand the complex interplay between work-related factors, individual factors, and musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare professionals to develop tailored interventions and strategies to promote their well-being and reduce the impact of these disorders on their professional lives. This study is the first of its kind at the provincial and regional level and one of the fewest studies conducted in Morocco among health professionals. The relevance of our study lies in its personal and professional nature, as it explores the issue of musculoskeletal disorders that threaten the quality of care and the personal and professional lives of the professional staff. The tool is primarily based on the Nordic questionnaire, a widely recognized instrument in several international studies. However, this study has several limits that should be considered.\n\nDue to time and accessibility constraints, the study was limited to healthcare staff in two hospital facilities. Achieving a higher level of representativeness would require expanding the study to a regional or national level. The factors associated with the prevalence of MSDs examined in this research were selected based on a recent literature review. However, other cognitive, biomechanical, psychosocial, and organizational factors could have been investigated.\n\nAnother limitation of our study is its cross-sectional design, which doesn't allow us to explore cause-and-effect relationships or implement preventive measures for MSDs. Our primary focus is on assessing the prevalence of MSDs.\n\nMoreover, it is essential to acknowledge that excluding professionals on leave from our study population constitutes a limitation. This limitation could impact the comprehensiveness of our findings, as it may not capture the full spectrum of musculoskeletal issues faced by healthcare workers.\n\nAcknowledging these limitations and considering them when interpreting the study findings is important. Future research should address these limitations by including a larger and more diverse sample and exploring additional factors that may contribute to developing MSDs among healthcare professionals.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThis study investigates the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among healthcare practitioners in a Moroccan provincial hospital center, shedding light on critical aspects of this specific healthcare environment. Our findings underscore the substantial burden of MSDs, with an overall prevalence of 89.2%. Lower back pain emerged as the most prevalent issue, affecting 63.3% of respondents over the past year.\n\nThe higher prevalence of MSDs among female practitioners (95.0%) compared to their male counterparts (77.5%) reveals a noteworthy gender-based disparity. Additionally, the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders is high among individuals with less than 10 years of experience (96.2%). Similarly, individuals in the age group of less than 31 years have a high prevalence percentage of musculoskeletal disorders (98.4%).\n\n _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH_ (_International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health_) https://ampphhealthjournal-network.org\n\nEvaluating the prevalence of MSDs in the specific healthcare environment studied is pivotal for crafting effective interventions tailored to the needs of local healthcare providers. This study is a cornerstone in this endeavor, significantly assessing MSD prevalence and associated factors.\n\nWhile our study presents significant insights, it is essential to acknowledge its limitations. Future research should investigate potential cause-and-effect relationships and explore context-specific preventive measures. Doing so can advance the collective effort toward optimizing healthcare professionals' occupational health and well-being.\n\n**Author Contributions:** Conceptualization, DA and HK; methodology, FC; software, BE and ME; validation, FC, NB and HK; formal analysis, KO and ZA; investigation, AA and HB; data curation, KO and AA; writing--original draft preparation, DA; writing--review and editing, AE and BE; supervision, FC; project administration, HK.

Herr\n\n1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11\n\n###### Abstract\n\n**Background** Elucidating underlying mechanisms in subject-specific motor control and perception after amputation could guide development of advanced surgical and neuroprosthetic technologies. In this study, relationships between preserved agonist-antagonist muscle strain within the residual limb and preserved motor control and perception capacity are investigated.\n\n**Methods** Fourteen persons with unilateral transtbial amputations spanning a range of ages, etiologies, and surgical procedures underwent evaluations involving free-space mirrored motions of their lower limbs. Research has shown that varied motor control in biologically intact limbs is executed by the activation of muscle synergies. Here, we assess the naturalness of phantom joint motor control postamputation based on extracted muscle synergies and their activation profiles. Muscle synergy extraction, degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain, and perception capacity are estimated from electromyography, ultrasonography, and goniometry, respectively.\n\n**Results** Here, we show significant positive correlations (_P_ < 0.005-0.05) between sensorimotor responses and residual limb agonist-antagonist muscle strain. Identified trends indicate that preserving even 20-26% of agonist-antagonist muscle strain within the residuum compared to a biologically intact limb is effective in preserving natural motor control postamputation, though preserving limb perception capacity requires more (61%) agonist-antagonist muscle strain preservation.\n\n**Conclusions** The results suggest that agonist-antagonist muscle strain is a characteristic, readily ascertainable residual limb structural feature that can help explain variability in amputation outcome, and agonist-antagonist muscle strain preserving surgical amputation strategies are one way to enable more effective and biomimetic sensorimotor control postamputation.\n\n**Plain language summary** People who undergo limb amputation can have issues with controlling movement and perception of residual limbs. This, in turn, can impact the success of neuroprosthetic strategies, which use signals from the body to control a prosthetic limb. Here, we wanted to understand how sensory signals within the muscle help to preserve movement and limb perception following amputation. We used ultrasound imaging and other methods to measure muscle activity and limb perception in fourteen people who have undergone lower limb amputations. We show that the level at which the relationship between pairs of related muscles is preserved is associated with more natural control of limb movement after amputation. Developing surgical techniques that preserve this relationship may help people living with amputations to naturally perceive and control their residual limbs, and ultimately may improve controllability of assistive prosthetic devices.\n\n Multi-degree-of-freedom- had been done according to Partner's Institutional Review Board protocol p2014001379 as in previous reports [24, 25].\n\nAs noted in the introduction section, the AMI transtibial amputation procedure creates mechanical linkages between two pairs of natively vascularized and innervated muscles within the residual limb; one pair for the missing ankle joint and another pair for the missing subtalar joint [22, 23]. For the ankle joint AMI construct, the tibialis anterior (TA) was linked to the lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and for the subtalar joint AMI construct, the tibialis posterior (TP) was linked to the peroneous longus (PL). The AMI amputation aims to emulate physiological antagonistic actuation between the residual limb muscles to restore AMS (Fig. 1a). In distinction, some non-AMI amputations may perturb AMS by severing or restricting residual agonist-antagonist muscle movements. Agonist-antagonist muscle couplings were not specifically reconstructed during conventional amputation or Ertl osteropoplasty amputation procedures [32, 16, 33]. Thus, the study population represented differing degrees of AMS within the residual musculature.\n\nWe collected EMG simultaneously from the TA, GA, TP, and PL muscles of both the residual limbs (AMI, CTL) and unaffected biologically intact limbs (BIO-A, BIO-C). A 2-DoF goniometer was also placed on the posterior aspect of the unaffected BIO limb spanning the ankle-foot complex (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c) to record mirrored movements between the intact and perceived phantom limb. We provided multiple motor control task instructions via on-screen and audio recordings. During motor control trials, no visual or other functional feedback was provided in an effort to focus on investigating the impact of proprioceptive feedback on motor control and limb perception capacity (Fig. 1b, c). To compute AMS, we utilized ultrasonography to record from the residual limbs while each subject repeated cyclic\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l}\n**Participant ID** & **Amputation type** & **Age** & **Time since amputation** & **Amputation** & **Biological sex** & **Height (m)** & **Weight (kg)** \\\\  & & **(years)** & **(years)** & **etiology** & & & \\\\ \\hline AMI-1/BIO-A1 & AMI & 43 & 1.6 & Thermal Injury & Female & 1.68 & 81 \\\\ AMI-2/BIO-A2 & AMI & 55 & 2.7 & Trauma & Male & 1.73 & 77 \\\\ AMI-3/BIO-A3 & AMI & 50 & 1.0 & Trauma & Female & 1.68 & 81 \\\\ AMI-4/BIO-A4 & AMI & 58 & 1.2 & Trauma & Male & 1.90 & 93 \\\\ AMI-5/BIO-A5 & AMI & 32 & 0.5 & Trauma & Male & 1.75 & 75 \\\\ AMI-6/BIO-A6 & AMI & 29 & 0.6 & Trauma & Male & 1.68 & 84 \\\\ AMI-7/BIO-A7 & AMI & 48 & 0.5 & Trauma & Male & 1.70 & 75 \\\\ CT-1/BIO-C1 & Standard & 25 & 1.4 & Oncological & Female & 1.64 & 54 \\\\ CT-2/BIO-C2 & Standard & 62 & 2.7 & Trauma & Female & 1.65 & 81 \\\\ CT-3/BIO-C3 & Standard & 25 & 2.0 & Talipes & Male & 1.78 & 108 \\\\  & & & & Eoinovirus & & & \\\\ CT-4/BIO-C4 & Standard & 39 & 2.7 & Trauma & Male & 1.60 & 63 \\\\ CT-5/BIO-C5 & Ertl osteropoplasty & 62 & 2.6 & Trauma & Male & 1.80 & 97 \\\\ CT-6/BIO-C6 & Standard & 61 & 5.3 & Trauma & Male & 1.73 & 91 \\\\ CT-7/BIO-C7 & Standard & 46 & 8.7 & Trauma & Male & 1.78 & 75 \\\\ Mean \u00b1 s.d. & \\(45\\pm 14\\) & \\(2.4\\pm 2.2\\) & & & & \\(1.72\\pm 0.08\\) & \\(81\\pm 14\\) \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Study population.\n\nFigure 1: Clinical evaluation of sensorimotor responses and the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) for participant\u2019s residual limb muscles. Shown in **a**, the Agonist-antagonist Mynoural Interface (AMI) amputation seeks to emulate physiological actuation of antagonistic muscle contraction and stretch. Angle and subtalar AMI constructs are devised to create direct agonist-antagonist coupling for ankle dorsal and plantar flexion and for subtalar version and inversion. For the ankle joint AMI construct, the tibialis anterior (TA) is linked to the lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and for the subtalar joint AMI construct, the tibialis posterior (TP) is linked to the peroneous longus (PL). In **b** and **c**, the experimental setup is shown. Motor control and phantom limb perception capacity are assessed in free space without visual or any other functional feedback. Perturbed motor control and perception are anticipated if a critical degree of AMS is not preserved in the limb. Representations of the dorsal and plantar flexion synergic motor outputs are shown in green and red, respectively; different and different neural signals are shown in brown and yellow, respectively. Eversion and inversion were also tested but are not shown here. In **d**, AMS is computed from muscle fascicle changes during cyclic phantom ankle and subtalar joint movements. Here, the size and positioning of elements are representative and not to scale.\n\n plantarflexion-dorsiflexion (PF-DF) and inversion-eversion (IN-EV) mirrored phantom limb movements (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). The maximum muscle fascicle strains were then estimated from ultrasound video recordings which were further normalized by the nominal muscle fascicle strain ranges from a computational musculoskeletal limb model [34]. The average PF-DF and IN-EV AMS values were utilized to represent the degree of AMS within the residuum. Given this definition, the degree of AMS ranges from 0 to 1, where zero indicates that the subject preserved none of the AMS present in the biologically intact limb, and 1 indicates fully preserved biological AMS.\n\nSurface electrodes placements and EMG processing. Bipolar surface electrodes were acutely placed over each of the target muscles for EMG recording. The target muscles include GA, TA, TP, and PL of both the residuum and unaffected limb (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Ultrasound imaging was used to guide electrode placement when it was needed. All the EMG signals were off-line high-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter, 20 Hz cut-off frequency). The filtered EMG signals were full-wave rectified and low-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter, 5 Hz cut-off frequency) to compute muscle activation patterns. All EMG signals were normalized to calibrated maxima for each muscle.\n\nMuscle synergy extraction and synergy activation profile.The motor control of residual limbs was evaluated by muscle synergy extraction from muscle activation patterns during discrete ankle and subthal joint movement trials. Subjects were asked to sequentially make PF, IN, DF, and EV movements of both the residual (phantom) and biologically intact limbs. The order of discrete movement trials was not randomized in an effort to identify existing motor capabilities for the 4 principal movements as accurately as possible. Discrete movements were repeated 40 times. We used a generally accepted mathematical model [29] for the representation of motor outputs as muscle synergy combinations as\n\n\\[\\bm{m}(t)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}(t)\\bm{w}_{i}+\\epsilon(t)\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(\\bm{m}(t)\\) is the muscle activation patterns at time \\(t\\); \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\)th muscle synergy vector; \\(c_{i}(t)\\) is the time-varying coefficient, or synergy activation, for \\(i\\)-th muscle synergy vector. \\(N\\) is the total number of muscle synergy vectors composing the muscle activation patterns; and \\(\\epsilon(t)\\) is the residual. Briefly, this model represents the muscle activation patterns as linear combinations of a set of time-invariant muscle synergy vectors that are activated by time-varying coefficients. As is generally accepted in the field, we consider \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\)as a muscle synergy profile that has a structural basis in the nervous system and consider \\(c_{i}(t)\\) as an index of motor commands, or synergy activations. Muscle synergies were extracted by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm [35]. The NMF was started with the initialization of time-varying coefficients and muscle synergy vectors to random positive values in the [0 1] interval. The goodness of fit metric of decomposed matrices was evaluated by variance accounted for (VAF) [36]. The NMF was continued until the change in VAF in 50 consecutive iterations was less than a tolerance of 1\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-5}\\). To reduce the probability of finding a local minimum solution for the NMF optimization, the same procedures were repeated 30 times with different sets of initial conditions, and the solution with the most VAF was selected. The number of muscle synergies was selected as the least number of synergies that could adequately reconstruct the muscle activation patterns, as determined by VAF\\(>\\) 0.95 [36]. To enable intrasubject comparisons of motor commands, the average vectors of synergy activation profiles \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{task}}\\)were used, or\n\n\\[\\bm{u}_{\\text{task}}=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{task}}}c _{i}(t)dt}{T_{\\text{task}}}\\hat{\\bm{n}}_{i}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\bm{n}}_{i}\\) is a unit vector in synergy space indicating activation of synergy vector \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\); \\(T_{\\text{task}}\\) is a time period of a given task. To identify motor commands for PF, DF, IN, and EV, the muscle activation patterns for each discrete movement were gathered and synergy activation vectors were computed independently. Then, the synergy activation vectors were normalized for further analysis.\n\nNaturalness of muscle synergy and synergy activation.We quantified the naturalness of muscle synergy and synergy activation profiles of AMI and CTL groups by computing their similarities to the average normalized values of the BIO group. Specifically, a muscle synergy of one subject was considered to correspond to a muscle synergy of another subject when the maximum of the scalar products was found among others. After sorting the muscle synergy vectors, the representative muscle synergy vectors of the BIO group were determined as the normalized average muscle synergy vectors of the BIO group. Finally, the naturalness of one's muscle synergy was calculated by plotting the mean scalar products with the representative of the BIO group. Similarly, the naturalness of one's synergy activation vectors was calculated by plotting the mean scalar products with the normalized average synergy activation vectors of the BIO group. For the BIO group, a leave-one-out procedure was used for computing their dot products. The universal number of synergy vectors for similarities analysis was unified to 3 muscle synergy vectors, which was the number of synergy vectors of all subjects in the BIO group. When fewer synergy vectors were identified previously by synergy extraction procedures, \\(\\bm{0}\\) vectors were added to muscle synergy and synergy activation vectors to match the dimensionality of vectors.\n\nRobustness of synergy activation.We quantified the robustness of ankle and subthalar volitional control based on the degree of decoupling between synergy activations for different target movements. The angle between two average vectors of synergy activations for two different target movements indicates the tolerance to variance in motor commands of two corresponding targeted movements. When the tolerance of motor commands is larger than the expected variance, it indicates that a subject can reliably produce distinguishable synergy activation for two discrete movements of interest. Therefore, the margin of synergy activation is given as\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\bigotimes_{ij}=&\\text{acos}\\Big{(} \\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\\bullet\\bm{u}_{j}\\Big{)}-\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{task},i}}\\int_{0}^{T_{ \\text{task},i}}\\bigg{|}\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\\bullet\\frac{\\bm{c}_{i}(t )}{\\parallel\\bm{c}_{i}(t)\\parallel}\\right)\\bigg{|}dt\\\\ &-\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{task},j}}\\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{task},i}} \\bigg{|}\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{j}^{T}\\bullet\\frac{\\bm{c}_{j}(t)}{\\parallel \\bm{c}_{j}(t)\\parallel}\\right)\\bigg{|}dt\\\\ &(i\\neq j,i,j\\in\\{\\text{PF},\\text{DF},\\text{IN},\\text{EV}\\}) \\end{split}\\] (3)\n\nwhere \\(\\bm{\\phi}_{ij}\\) is the margin in synergy activations to have distinguishable patterns between targeted \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) discrete movements; \\(T_{\\text{task},i}\\) is the interval time of \\(i\\) discrete movement. Note that the first term in the right-hand side of the equation is the angle between two synergy activation average vectors (tolerance); the second and third terms are variability in motor commands corresponding to the two discrete movements. The thresholds of 0 were selected for synergy activation margin to determine robustly decoupled discrete movements.\n\n \n\n**Synergy space (\\(U_{s}\\)-space) and motor intent decoding (\\(a\\)-space)**. We decoded the motor intents from arbitrary muscle activation patterns based on the extracted muscle synergy and synergy activation average vector of the 4 principal movements (PF, DF, IN, EV). The time-varying coefficients of the arbitrary muscle activation patterns were decomposed by revised NMF, fixing synergy vectors as the extracted muscle synergy from discrete movement trials during NMF iterations [37]. The same initialization and iteration protocols were utilized as those of muscle synergy extraction procedures for the rest of decomposition procedures. Given the revised NMF, the arbitrary muscle activation patterns can be reflected into the muscle synergy space of the discrete ankle and subtaric joint movements. This reflected time-varying coefficients at time \\(t\\), \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\), is further decoded into motor intents of ankle and subtaric movements by using the synergy activation vector of 4 discrete movements, \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PF}}\\), \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}\\), \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}\\), and \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{EV}}\\), as\n\n\\[\\begin{split} a_{\\text{PFPF}}(t)&=\\frac{1}{\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PF}}^{T}\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}\\right)}\\left(\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PP}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|} \\right)\\right.\\\\ &\\quad-\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{ \\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|}\\right)\\right)\\end{split}\\] (4)\n\n\\[\\begin{split} a_{\\text{INEV}}(t)&=\\frac{1}{\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}^{T}\\bm{u}_{\\text{IF}}\\right)}\\left(\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|} \\right)\\right.\\\\ &\\quad-\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{EV}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{ \\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|}\\right)\\right)\\end{split}\\] (5)\n\nwhere \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) indicate directions of desired movements in ankle and subtaric DoF, respectively. Given these definitions, \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) and the \\(a\\)-space consists of \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) served as a phase domain of motor control. The universal dimensionality of decomposed \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) was unified as 3, which was the dimensionality of decomposed \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) of all subjects in the BIO group. When fewer synergy vectors were identified previously by synergy extraction procedures, \\(\\bm{\\theta}\\) vectors were added in \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) to match dimensionality of vectors.\n\n**2-DoF motor controllability**. We quantified simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability by investigating the transitions in directionality of motor intent during 10 cycles of the drawing-a-circle tasks. First, the \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) was reflected into \\(a\\)-space. To draw an ideal circle in joint space, the directionality of motor intent in both ankle and subtaric DoF needs to be changed simultaneously. This is equivalent to simultaneous changes in both \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\). resulting in diagonal trajectory in \\(a\\)-space. Meanwhile, if the subject is only able to perform a single DoF motor control at a time, only changes in \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) or \\(a_{\\text{PPF}}\\) is found at a time. This is equivalent to a horizontal or vertical trajectory in \\(a\\)-space. Therefore, 2-DoF motor controllability was calculated by integrating diagonal components of trajectories within \\(a\\)-space to evaluate the simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability, or\n\n\\[\\begin{split} 2\\text{-DoF motor controllability}&=1-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{4}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n_{i}}\\frac{1}{T_{E,i}^{i}-T_{S,i}^{i}}\\\\ &\\int_{T_{V_{i}}^{i}}^{T_{V_{i}}}\\text{acos}\\left(\\delta_{11} \\cdot\\frac{|\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}|}{\\|\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}\\|}\\right)dt\\end{split}\\] (6)\n\nwhere \\(n_{j}\\) is the number of trajectories in \\(j\\)-th quadrant of \\(a\\)-space; \\(T_{S,i}^{i}\\) and \\(T_{E,i}^{i}\\) indicate the start and end time of \\(i\\)th trajectory in \\(j\\)th quadrant, respectively; \\(\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}\\) and \\(\\dot{\\bm{\\delta}}_{11}\\) are a velocity vector in \\(a\\)-space and unit diagonal vector, given as \\([\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}]\\), respectively. The trajectories in \\(a\\)-space were evaluated by each quadrant independently to investigate multi-DoF motor controllability of different combinations of discrete movements. The average diagonal components of trajectories on each quadrant were computed and normalized by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Finally, the mean values of diagonal components of all quadrants were calculated. If no full trajectories were present in a quadrant, it was considered as zero diagonal component for that quadrant. Note that the second term on the right-hand side of the equation converges to zero and 2-DoF motor controllability becomes 1 when all the trajectories in all quadrants are composed by only diagonal components. Thus, given this definition, 2-DoF motor controllability ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n**Evaluation of spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints**. Spatiotemporal motor control was evaluated from two metrics, motor control performance and economy of motion under increasing time constraints from 2.0 s to 1.5 s, 1 s, 0.8 s, and 0.5 s. For the visualization, an index of difficulty (ID) of speed-accuracy task for each time constraint (2.0-0.5 s) was calculated as the logarithm of the inverse of the time constraint and scaled to range from 0 to 1 (ID\\({}_{2.0}\\)-ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)), inspired by Fitts' law [38, 39, 40]. Speed-accuracy tasks comprised 10 repetitions in each of discrete PF, DF, IN, EV movements in a random order for each of 5 time-interval settings. The motor control performance was analyzed based on the tracking errors between the decoded motor intent \\(\\bm{\\alpha}\\), and ideal targets of \\(j\\) discrete movement \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{j}\\) in \\(a\\)-space, as\n\n\\[\\text{motor control performance}=1-\\frac{1}{2(T_{E}-T_{S})}\\int_{T_{S}}^{T_{E}}| \\chi_{j}-\\alpha(t)|dt.\\] (7)\n\nIdeal target movements in \\(a\\)-space \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{PP}}\\), \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{DP}}\\), \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{IN}}\\), and \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{EV}}\\) were defined as (0, \\(-1\\)), (0, 1), (\\(-1\\), 0), and (1, 0), respectively. Given this definition, the motor control performance shows how one can maintain motor intent corresponding to given motor tasks. Economy of motion was computed by the ratio of effective synergy activation for targeted \\(j\\) discrete movements to total synergy activation, or\n\n\\[\\text{economy of motion}=\\frac{1}{T_{E}-T_{S}}\\int_{T_{s}}^{T_{E}}\\frac{|\\bm{\\alpha} (t)|}{|\\bm{\\alpha}(t)|}dt\\] (8)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) is effective synergy activation for targeted \\(j\\) discrete movements, determined as \\(a_{\\text{PPF}}\\) for PF and DF and \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) for IN and EV. Given this definition, the economy of motion indicates the trajectory straightness of movements that were produced to achieve the target discrete movements.\n\n**Assessment of phantom limb perception capacity**. A psychometric task was used to assess limb perception capacity of the phantom limbs across the full perceived ranges of motion (ROM) for DF-PF and IN-EV. The mirrored perceived phantom limb positions were measured by goniometry from the subjects' BIO limb and were normalized by the ROM of the BIO limb (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) to allow comparison when plotted against the intended phantom limb positions (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) assessed from the EMG data. The intended limb position was assessed by the average value of \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\parallel a_{\\text{PFF}}\\) and \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\parallel a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) for each movement which show the both direction and amplitude of desired movements. To vary the phantom limb position while considering the range of motion of each joint, the subjects were guided to perform 25, 50, 75, and 100% PF and DF range of motion during separate, 40 randomized PF and DF trials, and 50 and 100% range of motion during 30 randomized IN and EV trials. The limb perception capacity was estimated based on the relationship between the intended phantom limb positions and the mirrored perceived phantom limb positions, determined as the mean value of the ranges between 5 and 95% of the psychometric functions. When a subject reported either zero phantom limb sensation or inconsistent phantom limb sensation tothe intended limb positions, the limb perception capacity was determined as zero. When 5 or 95% of the psychometric function was not reached, the minimum or maximum value of the psychometric function was selected.\n\n**Assessment of phantom limb sensations.** The reported phantom limb sensation scores focused on the vividness of their phantom limb sensations compared to actual sensations of their biologically intact limb during ankle, subtalar, and ankle/subtalar joint rotations. Subjects self-reported vividness of these phantom sensations on a scale of 0-to-10, where values of 0 and 10 respectively indicated no sensation or equivalent sensations for their phantom joint to their BIO limb. The full findings are given in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n**Statistics.** No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size a priori, but effect sizes were determined for the main outcomes using Cohen's \\(d\\) values between 1.26-to-1.35 (Supplementary Table 2). Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. The unaffected limbs of all subjects served as the biologically intact limb population when appropriate, thus no separate non-amputated subjects were recruited. In all experiments, except when specifically noted, the order of the motor control tasks was randomized as described in the relevant Methods sections and in the Nature Research Reporting Summary. Six sensory-motor response variables were correlated with the degree of AMS for the pooled dataset of all 14 subjects' residual limbs (CTL-1-7 and AMI-1-7). A non-parametric correlation, Kendall's tau (\\(\\tau\\)), and \\(P\\) value were computed to address a positive association between each response variable and the degree of AMS. A first order exponential response curve was fitted to address a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS\\)) that preserves 95% of each sensory-motor response variable. Jackknife mean \\(\\pm\\) standard deviation (s.d.) of \\(AMS\\), and \\(R^{2}\\) values of fitted response curve for each response variable were reported. The normality of the motor control data was tested by a Shapiro-Wilk test at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). To consider within-subject limb differences (AMI:BIO-A and CTL:BIO-C), paired one-tailed \\(t\\)-tests were used at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), as all motor control data did not violate the data normality. To consider between-subject residual limb differences (AMI:CTL), unpaired two-tailed \\(t\\)-tests were used at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Interactive effects between limb subgroups (AMI:CTL x affect-dunaffected limb) were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). The full statistics are reported in the Supplementary Table 2.\n\n**Reporting summary.** Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Naturalness of motor control.** Varied motor control in biologically intact limbs is executed by the activation of combinations of muscle synergies (Fig. 2a) [28, 29, 30]. We evaluated the naturalness of motor control of amputees by computing similarities between muscle synergies and their activation profiles for residual limbs and biologically intact limbs. We used a linear synergy model to extract muscle synergy and activation profiles from recorded EMG using a dimensionality-reduction technique [28, 29, 30]. The subjects performed discrete ankle and subtalar motion tasks that were assigned in the chronological order of PF-IN-DF-EV, which was not randomized in an effort to identify existing muscle synergies for the 4 principal movements as accurately as possible for the forthcoming analyses. The extracted muscle synergies and average vectors of synergy activation profiles for all 28 limbs are shown in Fig. 2b, c, respectively. All BIO-A, BIO-C, AMI, and 4/7 CTL limbs indicated 3 muscle synergies performing 4 principal ankle and subtalar movements. All BIO and AMI limbs shared common muscle synergies; one synergy (\\(W_{1}\\)) was dominated by GA and TP muscle activations, and the other 2 synergies (\\(W_{2}\\) and \\(W_{3}\\)) were respectively dominated by PL and TA activations. However, muscle synergies were altered in 5/7 CTL limbs as follows: CTL-1-4 all differed from BIO limbs in \\(W_{2}\\) or \\(W_{3}\\), showing coactivation tendencies. CTL-2-4, and CTL-6 also differed from BIO limbs in \\(W_{1}\\), showing altered GA and TP coordination profiles (Supplementary Fig. 2b).\n\nThe muscle synergy similarity (m.s.s.) and synergy activation similarity (s.a.s.) between each subject's residual limb and the average profiles across all 14 subjects' biologically intact limbs was plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 2d, e). Both trends showed significant positive associations (m.s.s.: \\(\\tau=0.54\\), \\(P<0.01\\); s.a.s.: \\(\\tau=0.56\\), \\(P<0.005\\)). Relatively low values of the critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{c}\\)) were anticipated to preserve 95% of natural discrete motor control for the residual limb (m.s.s.: \\(AMS_{c}=0.21\\), \\(R^{2}=0.94\\); s.a.s.: \\(AMS_{c}=0.22\\), \\(R^{2}=0.84\\)). The results provide evidence in support of the degree of AMS within residual muscles enabling natural, discrete motor control.\n\nFurther analyses (Fig. 2f, g and Supplementary Table 2) found significant differences for AMI:CTL comparisons (m.s.: \\(t=3.30\\), \\(P<0.01\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=2.99\\), \\(P<0.02\\)), significant differences for CTL:BIO-C comparisons (m.s.s.: \\(t=3.37\\), \\(P<0.01\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=3.27\\), \\(P<0.01\\)), and no significant differences for AMI:BIO-A comparisons (m.s.: \\(t=0.48\\), \\(P=0.33\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=1.79\\), \\(P=0.06\\)). Further, subgroup analyses amongst the 28 limbs revealed significant interactive effects (AMI:CTL x affected:unaffected limb) for muscle synergy similarity and synergy activation similarity (m.s.: \\(F=10.68\\), \\(P<0.005\\), s.a.s.: \\(F=9.22\\), \\(P<0.01\\)). Together, the results suggest that advanced amputation procedures that actively preserve even a small degree of AMS may effectively preserve natural discrete motor control after amputation.\n\n**Robust multi-degrees-of-freedom motor control**. High reliability of motor control that is consistent and cohesive, even in the absence of visual or other functional feedback, is anticipated to provide stable neural signaling and thereby enable neuroprosthetic control. To assess robust motor control for ankle and subtalar joint movements, we investigated the variability in synergy activation profiles for each movement (Fig. 3a). Synergy activation profiles differed for different movement tasks. All BIO-A, BIO-C, and AMI limbs produced 4 distinct synergy activations for the ankle and subtalar joint movements (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 2b). In contrast, only 3/7 CTL limbs were able to produce 4 distinct synergy activations for ankle and subtalar movements.\n\nTo evaluate simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability, we asked the subjects to attempt 'drawing a circle' with mirroring, of their phantom foot and biologically intact foot by simultaneously controlling their ankle and subtalar joints. We decoded the measured muscle activations into synergy activations (Fig. 3c, \\(U_{3}\\)) using the previously identified muscle synergies (\\(W_{1}\\)-\\(W_{1}\\)) and a matrix decomposition technique [37]. We then computed motor intents from the synergy activations based on the average vectors of synergy activation profiles of the 4 principal ankle and subtalar joint movements, transforming into the \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3). The \\(\\alpha\\)-space presents the directions of desired movements from the decoded synergy activations. When the circle is drawn with ankle and subtalar movement transitions in concert, the directionality of motor intents for ankle and subtalar joints changes simultaneously, resulting in diamond-type trajectories consisting of diagonals in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Fig. 3d, e). In contrast, single DoF motor control would be addressed as a change in either \\(\\alpha_{\\rm{PPPP}}\\) or \\(\\alpha_{\\rm{INEV}}\\), resulting in rectangle-type trajectories in \\(\\alpha\\)-space. Therefore, we quantified 2-DoF motor controllability of each limb by computing the mean value of the diagonal components of traces in \\(\\alpha\\)-space.\n\nThe 2-DoF motor controllability plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 3f) showed significant positive associations (\\(\\tau=0.58\\), \\(P<0.005\\)), and a relatively low \\(AMS_{c}\\) was anticipated to preserve 95% of 2-DoF motor controllability for the residual limb (\\(AMS_{c}=0.26\\), \\(R^{2}=0.89\\)). Significant interactive effects (Fig. 3g, F = 12,22, \\(P<0.005\\)) were found for 2-DoF motor controllability between amputation subgroup and limb category (AMI:CTL \\(\\times\\) affected-unaffected limb). Also, significant differences in 2-DoF motor controllability were found between CTL and BIO-C limbs (\\(t=3.25\\), \\(P<0.01\\)) and between AMI and CTL limbs (\\(t=3.42\\), \\(P<0.01\\)), whereas no significant difference was found between BIO-A and AMI limbs (\\(t=0.60\\), \\(P=0.28\\)).\n\nTogether, our results suggest that AMS within residual muscles enhances the decoupling and stabilization of the motor behaviors for discrete ankle and subtalar joint movements, allowing robust, simultaneous 2-DoF motor control of the residual limbs without visual or other functional feedback. Further, our results imply that amputation procedures that actively preserve biological AMS may effectively preserve multi-DoF motor control after amputation.\n\n### Spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints\n\nWe investigated the impact of AMS within residual muscles on spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints through speed-accuracy motor tasks, also referred to as Fits' law-type motor tasks [38, 39, 40]. We imposed time constraints, of 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, or 0.5 s, within which subjects were asked to perform the 4 discrete ankle and subtalar movements (Fig. 4a). For each time interval setting, PF, DF, IN, and EV movement tasks were presented in randomized order. Spatiotemporal motor control performance was quantified from errors between target motor tasks and decoded motor intents in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Supplementary Fig. 4). An index of difficulty (ID) of this task was calculated for each time\n\nFigure 2: **Naturalness of motor control.** In **a**, the framework of muscle synergies is shown. Varied motor control is executed by the activation of combinations of muscle synergies. In **b**, the extracted muscle synergies of all 28 limbs including the affected limbs of 14 subjects who had undergone either an Agostar-antagonist Movement Interface (AMI) amputation or a non-AMI amputation (CTL), and their unaffected limbs (BIO) are shown (BIO: \\(n=14\\), AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). The muscle synergies were extracted from motor outputs of 4 muscles: the tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and peroneus longus (PL). In **c**, the average vectors of synergy activation profiles are shown. These vectors were derived from the muscle synergies found during discrete motion testing of all 28 limbs (BIO: \\(n=14\\), AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). Each axis (\\(c_{1}c_{2}\\)) indicates the activation of a muscle synergy (\\(\\bm{W}\\),\\(\\bm{W}_{3}\\)). Here, the four different colors indicate the movements of plantar(PF, red), dorsification (DF, green), inversion (IN, blue), and aversion (EV, black). In **d** and **e**, the relationships between muscle synergy similarity and synergy activation similarity are shown with the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(n=14\\)). Reported are the Kendall\u2019s tau (\\(\\tau\\)), \\(P\\), \\(R^{2}\\), the Jackknife mean, and s.d. for a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{c}\\)). In **f** and **g** comparisons are shown of individual and interactive effects (AM:CTL \\(\\times\\) affectedundaffected limb) for muscle synergy similarity and synergy activation similarity for all 28 limbs (BIO: \\(n=14\\), AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). Here paired one-tailed \\(t\\)-tests were used for BIO-A-AMI and BIO-C:CTL comparisons, unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used for the AMI:CTL comparison, and 2-way ANOVA was used for the interaction analysis (\\(P<0.05\\), \\(\\bm{\\gamma}P<0.01\\)). Where no significance is seen, a \\(P\\) value for the comparison is shown.\n\n constraint (2.0-0.5 s) as the logarithm of the inverse of the time constraint and scaled to range from 0 to 1 (ID\\({}_{2.0}\\)-ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)).\n\nAs visualized by 4 different colors in Fig. 4b, AMI-1 successfully performed the speed-accuracy motor tasks at all time constraint settings, producing 4 distinct synergy activations, one corresponding to each target motor task. Conversely, CTL-2 could successfully perform the speed-accuracy motor task only if allowed a longer time interval (ID\\({}_{1.5}\\) or ID\\({}_{1.5}\\)) as evidenced by loss of the boundaries\n\nFig. 3: **Multi-degree-of-freedom motor control.** In **a**, representative data are plotted that were collected during testing of the 4 discrete movements, and an illustration of robustly distinct and fused synergy activation profiles are shown. Here, the four different colors indicate the movements of plantarflexion (PF, red), dorsflexion (DF, green), inversion (IN, blue), and aversion (EV, black). Each axis (\\(c_{1}\\)-\\(c_{2}\\)) indicates the activation of a muscle synergy (\\(\\textbf{W}_{1}\\)-\\(\\textbf{W}_{3}\\)).\n\nAgostriatal-magnositral Hyonverniel Interface (AMI); affected limbs of participants who underwent an AMI amputation (AMI-1-7); affected limbs of participants who underwent a Non-AMI control amputation (CTL-1-7); unaffected biologically-interact limbs (BIO-A1-7 and BIO-CI-7). In **b**, illustrations of the 4 discrete joint movements and the degree of decoupled motor behaviors are shown for synergy activation profiles of 14 subjects (AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). Shown in **c** are diagrams of the \\(\\alpha\\)-space transformation used to decode motor intention of an arbitrary motor output (\\(\\textbf{U}_{3}=[c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\), \\(c_{3}\\))) from the average vectors of synergy activation profiles for the 4 discrete movements (\\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\)). Directionally of motor intentions in an ankle joint (\\(a_{\\text{MFMF}}\\)) and subtra joint (\\(a_{\\text{MFMF}}\\)) are computed based on angles (\\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{FF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\)) and \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\)) between \\(\\textbf{U}_{3}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{\\theta}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\n\n between the 4 targets with increasing time constraint (ID\\({}_{1.0}\\)-ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)). Motor control performance plotted against the degree of AMS showed significant positive associations (\\(\\tau=0.61\\pm 0.07\\), \\(P<0.01\\)) across all IDs (Fig. 4c, d). We further investigated the economy of motion through trajectory straightness of the performed synergy activations during targeted movement tasks. Economy of motion responses plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 4e, f) showed significant positive associations against AMS (\\(\\tau=0.49\\pm 0.02\\), \\(P<0.05\\)).\n\nOur results suggest that a higher degree of preserved AMS can provide a person with an amputation more sustained economy of motion, with minimized wasted movements, during spatiotemporal motor tasks. Conversely, a subject with limited AMS was less able to maintain efficacious motion and 'wanderd' more during spatiotemporal motor control performance tasks shown as a low economy of motion. We speculate that the afferent feedback inherent in residual limb AMS may reduce 'trembling' of neuroprosthetic control in the absence of visual or other functional\n\nFig. 4: **Spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints.** In **a**, an illustration is shown of a subject performing randomized, discrete ankle and subtlar joint motion tasks under varying time constraint (2-0.5 s), or index of difficulty (ID\\({}_{2.0}\\) - ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)). To decode motor intentions of recorded motor outputs, first, synergy activations (\\(\\varsigma_{1}\\)-\\(\\varsigma_{2}\\)) are calculated using the muscle synergies (\\(\\textbf{W}_{1}\\)-\\(\\textbf{W}_{2}\\)) previously identified during 4 discrete motion testing of plantarflexion (PF), dorsification (DF), inversion (IN), and aversion (EV). Finally, directionality of motor intentions in an ankle joint (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)) and subtlar joint (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)) are computed based on the average vectors of synergy activation profiles for the 4 discrete movements \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\) and the synergy activation vector of recorded motor outputs (\\(\\textbf{U}_{5}\\) = [\\(\\varsigma_{1}\\), \\(\\varsigma_{2}\\), \\(\\varsigma_{3}\\))]. In **b**, motor control performance is shown for two representative subjects in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\) and \\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)). The Agonist-antagonist Movement Interface (AMU) subject maintained all 4 discrete movements up to the highest difficulty level with time constraint (0.5 s, ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)). In contrast, the non-AMI control (CTL) subject started to lose boundaries at ID\\({}_{0.8}\\) and completely lost them at ID\\({}_{0.5}\\). Relationships are shown in **e** and **f** between the motor control performance and the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(\\tau=14\\)) at all IDs. Further, relationships are shown in **e** and **f** between the economy of motion and the degree of AMS using a similar combined analysis (\\(\\tau=14\\)). Motor control performance and the economy of motion were evaluated by the error and straightness of motor control traces to the target motor tasks. Kendall\u2019s tau coefficients (\\(\\tau\\)), \\(P\\), \\(R^{2}\\), and the Jackknife mean and s.d. of a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{\\varsigma}\\)) are reported.\n\n feedback to enable improved neuroprosthetic control, as will be further discussed in the Discussion section.\n\n**Subject-specific proprioceptive limb perception**. After signals from sensory receptors involved in proprioception[1] exert a strong influence on both motor control[41] and proprioceptive limb perception[41, 42, 4]. If the degree of residual AMS is a critical neurophysiological determinant underlying natural motor control preservation after limb amputation, we postulate that AMS should also contribute to preserving proprioceptive phantom limb perception. To explore this experimentally, we asked the subjects to move and vary their phantom foot positions to 25, 50, 75, and 100% of their DF or PF range of motion, and to 50 and 100% of their IN or EV range of motion, while mirroring phantom limb perception with their biologically intact foot. We assessed the intended phantom limb positions (\\(\\theta\\)) from EMG as \\(\\bm{U}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\parallel\\alpha_{\\mathrm{FEDF}}\\) and \\(\\bm{U}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\parallel\\alpha_{\\mathrm{INV}}\\) which indicate both direction and amplitude of the desired movements (Fig. 5a). The measured mirrored perceived phantom limb position (\\(\\theta\\)) was accessed by goniometry and normalized by the range of motion of the BIO limb.\n\nWe estimated the values of limb perception capacity based on the psychometric function defined by plotting \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) against \\(\\theta\\) for each degree of freedom (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Data for three subjects--one who had undergone the AMI (AMI-1), another a traditional (CTL-3), and the other an osteomyelitismatic amputation[32, 33] (CTL-5) - are shown in Fig. 5a. AMI-1 exemplified high limb perception capacity (0.77) and a high capability to vary her phantom foot position. In contrast, CTL-3 demonstrated lower limb perception capacity (0.32) and restricted capability to vary the position of his phantom foot. Notably, CTL-5, who had undergone an Ertl ostemoplysmic amputation[32, 33], exhibited high limb perception capacity (0.60) and high capability to vary the position of his phantom foot. Consistently, when compared to the muscle dynamics presented\n\nFig. 5: **Subject-specific proprioceptive perception. In **a**, relationships are shown between the mirrored perceived phantom limb position as measured from the biologically-inter limb without visual feedback and the intended phantom limb positions for three representative subjects (AMI-1, CTL-3, and CTL-5), who had respectively undergone Ag Agnist-antagonist Movement Interface (AMI), traditional, and Ertl ostemoplysmic amputation procedures. Estimated limb perception capacity (Lp,c) is reported. In **b**, schematic diagrams are shown of the anticipated residual limb structures, based on ultrasonography, highlighting the dynamic AMI construct excursion in 2-Dof for AMI, restricted motion in control subjects (CTL-1, CTL-3, CTL-4, and CTL-6), and joystick-like\u2019 residual muscle coupling in control subjects (CTL-2, CTL-5, and CTL-7). Size and positioning of elements are representative and not to scale. In **c**, limb perception capacity of the phantom limb is plotted against the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(n=14\\)). Kendall\u2019s tau correlation (r), \\(P,R^{2}\\), and the Jackknife mean and s.d. of a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{c}\\)) are reported. The limb perception capacity for AMI-2 and CTL-2 (encircled) deviated from the trend.\n\n by AMI-1, CTL-3, and CTL-5, the ultrasound examination of CTL-5 revealed 2-DoF 'joystick-like' coupling between antagonistic muscle pairs that were distributed across the inferior aspect of his residual limb, as illustrated in the comparison shown in Fig. 5b.\n\nLimb perception capacity plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 5c) showed a significant positive association (\\(\\tau=0.58\\), \\(P<0.005\\)) across all 14 residual limbs. However, the \\(AMS_{c}\\) value was higher (\\(AMS_{c}=0.61\\), \\(R^{2}=0.45\\)) compared with the values of \\(AMS_{c}\\) identified to preserve natural muscle synergy, synergy activation similarity, and 2-DoF motor controllability (\\(AMS_{c}\\) ranged from 0.21-to-0.26). Our results suggest that subject-specific limb perception capacity is impacted by the degree of preserved residual muscle AMS after limb amputation. Our results further imply that a higher degree of preserved AMS within residual muscles may be required to preserve proprioceptive limb perception compared to the degree required to preserve biomimetic motor control. AMI-2 and CTL-2 (encircled, Fig. 5c), who deviated from the trend, reported no functional range of motion prior to their amputations during which time both experienced severe pain with attempted joint movements, as will be further discussed in the Discussion section.\n\n**Supplemental clinical metrics.** We have gathered and analyzed clinical metrics including correlations between time since amputation and sensory-motor responses, maximum EMG values, average cross section of scar tissue, and average phantom limb score (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1). No significant correlations, positive or negative, were found between muscle synergy similarity (AMI: \\(P=0.91\\), CTL: \\(P=0.42\\)), synergy activation similarity (AMI: \\(P=0.15\\), CTL: \\(P=0.25\\)), 2-DoF motor controllability (AMI: \\(P=0.33\\), CTL: \\(P=0.46\\)), or limb perception capacity (AMI: \\(P=0.11\\), CTL: \\(P=0.89\\)) and time since amputation for the 14 residual limbs. Also, no significant differences between the AMI and CTL subjects were seen in the maximum EMG values recorded from the four target muscles (TA: \\(t=1.41\\), \\(P=0.18\\), TP: \\(t=-0.30\\), \\(P=0.77\\), GA: \\(t=1.49\\), \\(P=0.16\\), PL: \\(t=-0.74\\), \\(P=0.48\\)), average scar tissue cross-sectional area (\\(t=0.11\\), \\(P=0.91\\)), quantified with ultrasonography[43], or average phantom limb pain score (\\(t=2.08\\), \\(P=0.06\\)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we have accumulated evidence that, for the specific free space motor tasks performed, the degree of AMS within residual limb muscles postamputation is the neuromechanical determinant underlying the large variability observed in subject-specific motor control and perception. Our work supports the hypothesis that preservation of transtibial residual-limb AMS can restore sensorimotor capacity postamputation.\n\nThe single metric, AMS, a characteristic residual-limb structural feature, enabled the correlation of 6 types of sensorimotor responses from 14 transtibial amputee participants. Not unexpectedly, residual limb AMS and sensorimotor responses were individuated amongst the 14 participants, spanning a broad range of ages, times since amputation, surgical procedures, and etiologies. It was therefore remarkable that, despite this inherent intrasubject variability, residual limb AMS was found to impact motor control and perception as an exponential response. The gradual and monotonic improvements with the degree of preserved AMS underscore the importance of surgical amputation strategies like the AMI that preserve AMS.\n\nBecause muscle synergies and proprioceptive limb perception are organized at the central nervous system (CNS) level[26, 28, 44], the critical level of AMS identified in the exponential response implies CNS sensitivity to modified AMS in preserving motor control and perception. This CNS sensitivity to modified AMS may be critical to understanding and predicting outcomes of advanced surgical augmentation strategies for motor control and proprioceptive perception. The \\(AMS_{c}\\) for muscle synergy, synergy activation similarity, and 2-DoF motor controllability range was 0.21-0.26, which predicts that about 21-26% AMS preservation will induce 95% preservation of natural motor control for discrete and multi-DoF movements. The finding that the \\(AMS_{c}\\) for phantom limb perception capacity was relatively high (0.61) suggests a higher degree of afferent signaling from AMS may be involved in the context of proprioceptive memory modulation[45, 46, 47, 4] compared to that required to preserve motor control. As a consequence of the difference in \\(AMS_{c}\\) for motor control versus proprioceptive percepts, subjects with an AMS preservation value close to the 21-26% range demonstrated a natural level of motor control but yet exhibited a limited degree of proprioceptive percepts. Such was the case for study participants AMI-3, AMI-7, CTL-5, and CTL-7 with AMS values equal to 19.2, 26.4, 23.2, and 23.8%, respectively.\n\nMuscle synergies in non-amputated humans reflect reflexive and afferent neural feedback in a manner dictated by muscul-lorendon length changes and joint biomechanics[48]. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to address the relationships between residual muscle biomechanics and muscle synergies in persons with major limb amputation. Together, our results suggest that AMS can provide a characteristic, readily ascertainable residual limb structural feature that can help to explain the variability in amputation outcomes and contribute together with other non-AMS factors including neuroplasticity, proprioceptive memory, neural signaling deficits, subject-specific perceptive responses, differences in scar tissue formation postamputation, and other biomechanical factors within the limb.\n\nIn this study, we address the beneficial outcomes of surgical paradigms that can actively preserve AMS during transtibial amputation. AMS preservation may also improve motor control and proprioceptive percepts for patients who undergo amputations at other anatomical levels. The AMI amputation procedure has now been conducted on over 30 patients at the transtibial, transfemoral, transradial and transhumeral levels to enable improved motor control and sensory perception in a broader population of amputee subjects[49]. When musculature distal to the amputation level is intact and viable, it may be harvested on a neurovascular leash during the amputation procedure, and AMS preservation can then be surgically implemented through muscle pair coupling and mechanical fixation of the construct to the surrounding fascia and muscle within the residuum[15, 50]. If musculature distal to the amputation level is not viable, then AMS preservation may be implemented by constructing a native AMI using large vascularized muscle with TMR nerve reintervention[15], or alternatively by constructing a regenerative AMI from reinervated muscle grafts[15, 51].\n\nIn some instances, it may not be feasible to surgically implement all agonist-antagonist muscle couplings to fully emulate intact-limb dynamics due to limited physical volume of the residuum skin envelope (e.g., in a transradial amputation). In this case, the AMI procedure may be applied to only major agonist-antagonist muscle pairs while other surgical strategies such as rPNI and TMR are applied to the remaining musculature sites and transacted nerves. Thus, through an integration of AMI, rPNI, and TMR techniques, the amputation procedure can be designed to improve motor control and sensory perception for patient-specific functional limb restoration[15]. Another consideration is operative time; AMS preservation during amputation requires a somewhat extended operation time[52, 5, 2], and as such may not be appropriate in some scenarios. In other cases, such as life-threatening emergencies, AMS may be excluded initially and introduced during a revision surgery, which is often performed to treat phantom limb pain or neuromon postamputation [20].\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of preserving AMS on motor control and sensory perception in free space using a synergy analysis that did not require a physical external prosthesis or a specific control system. In the EMG control of external powered prostheses, a critical challenge is the surface EMG electrodes needed for neuroprosthetic applications. Various research groups and companies are developing flexible, thin electrodes [53, 54] for in-socket EMG recordings from residual muscles. We developed and investigated film-thick electrodes [54] and a neuroprosthesis [55], with which we are exploring AMI amputee subjects' capabilities for level ground walking and terrain adaptation. We are also integrating AMI constructs with an osseintegration implant, wherein a bone-anchored mechanical conduit can allow percutaneous passage of 16 implanted leads for electrical stimulation of, and recording from, an amputee subject's residuum muscles [56]. In this approach implanted EMG electrodes are placed onto each AMI muscle with each electrode's wire leads passing through the osseointegrated implant.\n\nIn this study, we present a platform that combines muscle synergy analysis with biophysical and biomedical sciences to clinically demonstrate the impact of AMS on physiological motor control after limb amputation in 14 amputee subjects. Naturalness of motor control is investigated using the extracted muscle synergies and their activation profiles. Our approach reveals that preserving a relatively low degree of AMS in the residuum (20-26% of that in a biologically intact limb) is effective in preserving natural motor control postamptation, though preserving limb perception capacity requires a higher degree (61%) of AMS preservation. Our findings suggest that AMS-amputation strategies are one way to enable more effective and biomimetic sensorimotor control postamptation. Previously, the reasons underlying motor control and proprioceptive perception postamptation were poorly understood. The unique circumstances of our study population and dataset, which comprises 28 AMI and CTL limbs - their post-amputation residual limbs and biologically intact limbs--allowed the discovery of a fundamental index. The present approach provides a predictive index of postamptation outcome, \\(AMS_{\\infty}\\) derived through a combination of mathematical, biomechanical, and clinical data. Consequently, our findings offer new, meaningful insights into motor and sensory perturbations by people living with major limb amputation. With further refinement, the concept of a critical degree of AMS may elucidate fundamental factors underlying clinical outcomes after amputation and inform future amputation paradigms and neuroprosthetic system designs.\n\nFor the motor tasks performed, our study provided evidence to support the hypothesis that the degree of AMS within the transibial residuum is the neuromechanical determinant of subject-specific motor control and proprioceptive preservation. The main limitation of our study was its small population size--14 transibial amputees including 7 AMI and 7 non-AMI participants. We anticipate that future, larger studies will further elucidate the correlations established herein and provide further insight into how a multiplicity of factors such as age, time since amputation, body habitus, and amputation etiology may impact sensorimotor responses.\n\nEmulating the natural biomechanics of muscle interaction to impart a high degree of AMS in residual limbs requires a sophisticated surgical design. Surgical considerations include physiological muscle tensions in mechanical couplings, balanced muscle force capacities, and minimizing the mechanical impedance to enable freely moving agonist-antagonist muscle dynamics. In practice, taking these multiple factors into account during the amputation procedure is challenging. In this study, the large variance in AMS across the AMI cohort underscores the need for further optimization of AMI amputation technique to enable a more consistent AMS clinical outcome. More broadly, an exciting area of future research would be the development of residual limb architectures that enable direct computer control of mechano-neural transduction [49]. To this end, basic research advances are necessary in physiological actuators such as biocompatible synthetic actuators [57], intramuscular sensors [60, 58, 59, 70], and stimulators that can be implanted in series with residual muscle end organs.\n\nThe importance of mechanoeueral transduction within sensory organs for afferent signaling is well known [2, 4]. However, the motor control consequences of altered afferent signals by the macroscale reconfiguration of biomechanically-functional tissue architectures is not yet understood. Here we document the effects of modified afferent signaling from distinct functional tissue architectures of the transibial residuum by revealing the neuromechanical determinant, and the sensitivity of its impact on the CNS, to subject-specific residual motor control and phantom limb perception. Toward the design of biomimetic neural interfaces, we wish to underscore the value of surgical techniques that create a residuum tissue structure that preserves natural neuromuscular and biomechanical function.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data associated with this study are found in the main text and the Supplementary Materials.

In this study, relationships between preserved agonist-antagonist muscle strain within the residual limb and preserved motor control and perception capacity are investigated.\n\n**Methods** Fourteen persons with unilateral transtbial amputations spanning a range of ages, etiologies, and surgical procedures underwent evaluations involving free-space mirrored motions of their lower limbs. Research has shown that varied motor control in biologically intact limbs is executed by the activation of muscle synergies. Here, we assess the naturalness of phantom joint motor control postamputation based on extracted muscle synergies and their activation profiles. Muscle synergy extraction, degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain, and perception capacity are estimated from electromyography, ultrasonography, and goniometry, respectively.\n\n**Results** Here, we show significant positive correlations (_P_ < 0.005-0.05) between sensorimotor responses and residual limb agonist-antagonist muscle strain. Identified trends indicate that preserving even 20-26% of agonist-antagonist muscle strain within the residuum compared to a biologically intact limb is effective in preserving natural motor control postamputation, though preserving limb perception capacity requires more (61%) agonist-antagonist muscle strain preservation.\n\n**Conclusions** The results suggest that agonist-antagonist muscle strain is a characteristic, readily ascertainable residual limb structural feature that can help explain variability in amputation outcome, and agonist-antagonist muscle strain preserving surgical amputation strategies are one way to enable more effective and biomimetic sensorimotor control postamputation.\n\n**Plain language summary** People who undergo limb amputation can have issues with controlling movement and perception of residual limbs. This, in turn, can impact the success of neuroprosthetic strategies, which use signals from the body to control a prosthetic limb. Here, we wanted to understand how sensory signals within the muscle help to preserve movement and limb perception following amputation. We used ultrasound imaging and other methods to measure muscle activity and limb perception in fourteen people who have undergone lower limb amputations. We show that the level at which the relationship between pairs of related muscles is preserved is associated with more natural control of limb movement after amputation. Developing surgical techniques that preserve this relationship may help people living with amputations to naturally perceive and control their residual limbs, and ultimately may improve controllability of assistive prosthetic devices.\n\n Multi-degree-of-freedom- had been done according to Partner's Institutional Review Board protocol p2014001379 as in previous reports [24, 25].\n\nAs noted in the introduction section, the AMI transtibial amputation procedure creates mechanical linkages between two pairs of natively vascularized and innervated muscles within the residual limb; one pair for the missing ankle joint and another pair for the missing subtalar joint [22, 23]. For the ankle joint AMI construct, the tibialis anterior (TA) was linked to the lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and for the subtalar joint AMI construct, the tibialis posterior (TP) was linked to the peroneous longus (PL). The AMI amputation aims to emulate physiological antagonistic actuation between the residual limb muscles to restore AMS (Fig. 1a). In distinction, some non-AMI amputations may perturb AMS by severing or restricting residual agonist-antagonist muscle movements. Agonist-antagonist muscle couplings were not specifically reconstructed during conventional amputation or Ertl osteropoplasty amputation procedures [32, 16, 33]. Thus, the study population represented differing degrees of AMS within the residual musculature.\n\nWe collected EMG simultaneously from the TA, GA, TP, and PL muscles of both the residual limbs (AMI, CTL) and unaffected biologically intact limbs (BIO-A, BIO-C). A 2-DoF goniometer was also placed on the posterior aspect of the unaffected BIO limb spanning the ankle-foot complex (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c) to record mirrored movements between the intact and perceived phantom limb. We provided multiple motor control task instructions via on-screen and audio recordings. During motor control trials, no visual or other functional feedback was provided in an effort to focus on investigating the impact of proprioceptive feedback on motor control and limb perception capacity (Fig. 1b, c). To compute AMS, we utilized ultrasonography to record from the residual limbs while each subject repeated cyclic\n\n\nTable 1: Study population.\n\nFigure 1: Clinical evaluation of sensorimotor responses and the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) for participant\u2019s residual limb muscles. Shown in **a**, the Agonist-antagonist Mynoural Interface (AMI) amputation seeks to emulate physiological actuation of antagonistic muscle contraction and stretch. Angle and subtalar AMI constructs are devised to create direct agonist-antagonist coupling for ankle dorsal and plantar flexion and for subtalar version and inversion. For the ankle joint AMI construct, the tibialis anterior (TA) is linked to the lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and for the subtalar joint AMI construct, the tibialis posterior (TP) is linked to the peroneous longus (PL). In **b** and **c**, the experimental setup is shown. Motor control and phantom limb perception capacity are assessed in free space without visual or any other functional feedback. Perturbed motor control and perception are anticipated if a critical degree of AMS is not preserved in the limb. Representations of the dorsal and plantar flexion synergic motor outputs are shown in green and red, respectively; different and different neural signals are shown in brown and yellow, respectively. Eversion and inversion were also tested but are not shown here. In **d**, AMS is computed from muscle fascicle changes during cyclic phantom ankle and subtalar joint movements. Here, the size and positioning of elements are representative and not to scale.\n\n plantarflexion-dorsiflexion (PF-DF) and inversion-eversion (IN-EV) mirrored phantom limb movements (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1d, e). The maximum muscle fascicle strains were then estimated from ultrasound video recordings which were further normalized by the nominal muscle fascicle strain ranges from a computational musculoskeletal limb model [34]. The average PF-DF and IN-EV AMS values were utilized to represent the degree of AMS within the residuum. Given this definition, the degree of AMS ranges from 0 to 1, where zero indicates that the subject preserved none of the AMS present in the biologically intact limb, and 1 indicates fully preserved biological AMS.\n\nSurface electrodes placements and EMG processing. Bipolar surface electrodes were acutely placed over each of the target muscles for EMG recording. The target muscles include GA, TA, TP, and PL of both the residuum and unaffected limb (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Ultrasound imaging was used to guide electrode placement when it was needed. All the EMG signals were off-line high-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter, 20 Hz cut-off frequency). The filtered EMG signals were full-wave rectified and low-pass filtered (fourth-order zero-lag Butterworth filter, 5 Hz cut-off frequency) to compute muscle activation patterns. All EMG signals were normalized to calibrated maxima for each muscle.\n\nMuscle synergy extraction and synergy activation profile.The motor control of residual limbs was evaluated by muscle synergy extraction from muscle activation patterns during discrete ankle and subthal joint movement trials. Subjects were asked to sequentially make PF, IN, DF, and EV movements of both the residual (phantom) and biologically intact limbs. The order of discrete movement trials was not randomized in an effort to identify existing motor capabilities for the 4 principal movements as accurately as possible. Discrete movements were repeated 40 times. We used a generally accepted mathematical model [29] for the representation of motor outputs as muscle synergy combinations as\n\n\\[\\bm{m}(t)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}(t)\\bm{w}_{i}+\\epsilon(t)\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(\\bm{m}(t)\\) is the muscle activation patterns at time \\(t\\); \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\) is the \\(i\\)th muscle synergy vector; \\(c_{i}(t)\\) is the time-varying coefficient, or synergy activation, for \\(i\\)-th muscle synergy vector. \\(N\\) is the total number of muscle synergy vectors composing the muscle activation patterns; and \\(\\epsilon(t)\\) is the residual. Briefly, this model represents the muscle activation patterns as linear combinations of a set of time-invariant muscle synergy vectors that are activated by time-varying coefficients. As is generally accepted in the field, we consider \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\)as a muscle synergy profile that has a structural basis in the nervous system and consider \\(c_{i}(t)\\) as an index of motor commands, or synergy activations. Muscle synergies were extracted by the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm [35]. The NMF was started with the initialization of time-varying coefficients and muscle synergy vectors to random positive values in the [0 1] interval. The goodness of fit metric of decomposed matrices was evaluated by variance accounted for (VAF) [36]. The NMF was continued until the change in VAF in 50 consecutive iterations was less than a tolerance of 1\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-5}\\). To reduce the probability of finding a local minimum solution for the NMF optimization, the same procedures were repeated 30 times with different sets of initial conditions, and the solution with the most VAF was selected. The number of muscle synergies was selected as the least number of synergies that could adequately reconstruct the muscle activation patterns, as determined by VAF\\(>\\) 0.95 [36]. To enable intrasubject comparisons of motor commands, the average vectors of synergy activation profiles \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{task}}\\)were used, or\n\n\\[\\bm{u}_{\\text{task}}=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{\\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{task}}}c _{i}(t)dt}{T_{\\text{task}}}\\hat{\\bm{n}}_{i}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\bm{n}}_{i}\\) is a unit vector in synergy space indicating activation of synergy vector \\(\\bm{w}_{i}\\); \\(T_{\\text{task}}\\) is a time period of a given task. To identify motor commands for PF, DF, IN, and EV, the muscle activation patterns for each discrete movement were gathered and synergy activation vectors were computed independently. Then, the synergy activation vectors were normalized for further analysis.\n\nNaturalness of muscle synergy and synergy activation.We quantified the naturalness of muscle synergy and synergy activation profiles of AMI and CTL groups by computing their similarities to the average normalized values of the BIO group. Specifically, a muscle synergy of one subject was considered to correspond to a muscle synergy of another subject when the maximum of the scalar products was found among others. After sorting the muscle synergy vectors, the representative muscle synergy vectors of the BIO group were determined as the normalized average muscle synergy vectors of the BIO group. Finally, the naturalness of one's muscle synergy was calculated by plotting the mean scalar products with the representative of the BIO group. Similarly, the naturalness of one's synergy activation vectors was calculated by plotting the mean scalar products with the normalized average synergy activation vectors of the BIO group. For the BIO group, a leave-one-out procedure was used for computing their dot products. The universal number of synergy vectors for similarities analysis was unified to 3 muscle synergy vectors, which was the number of synergy vectors of all subjects in the BIO group. When fewer synergy vectors were identified previously by synergy extraction procedures, \\(\\bm{0}\\) vectors were added to muscle synergy and synergy activation vectors to match the dimensionality of vectors.\n\nRobustness of synergy activation.We quantified the robustness of ankle and subthalar volitional control based on the degree of decoupling between synergy activations for different target movements. The angle between two average vectors of synergy activations for two different target movements indicates the tolerance to variance in motor commands of two corresponding targeted movements. When the tolerance of motor commands is larger than the expected variance, it indicates that a subject can reliably produce distinguishable synergy activation for two discrete movements of interest. Therefore, the margin of synergy activation is given as\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\\bigotimes_{ij}=&\\text{acos}\\Big{(} \\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\\bullet\\bm{u}_{j}\\Big{)}-\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{task},i}}\\int_{0}^{T_{ \\text{task},i}}\\bigg{|}\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\\bullet\\frac{\\bm{c}_{i}(t )}{\\parallel\\bm{c}_{i}(t)\\parallel}\\right)\\bigg{|}dt\\\\ &-\\frac{1}{T_{\\text{task},j}}\\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{task},i}} \\bigg{|}\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{j}^{T}\\bullet\\frac{\\bm{c}_{j}(t)}{\\parallel \\bm{c}_{j}(t)\\parallel}\\right)\\bigg{|}dt\\\\ &(i\\neq j,i,j\\in\\{\\text{PF},\\text{DF},\\text{IN},\\text{EV}\\}) \\end{split}\\] (3)\n\nwhere \\(\\bm{\\phi}_{ij}\\) is the margin in synergy activations to have distinguishable patterns between targeted \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) discrete movements; \\(T_{\\text{task},i}\\) is the interval time of \\(i\\) discrete movement. Note that the first term in the right-hand side of the equation is the angle between two synergy activation average vectors (tolerance); the second and third terms are variability in motor commands corresponding to the two discrete movements. The thresholds of 0 were selected for synergy activation margin to determine robustly decoupled discrete movements.\n\n \n\n**Synergy space (\\(U_{s}\\)-space) and motor intent decoding (\\(a\\)-space)**. We decoded the motor intents from arbitrary muscle activation patterns based on the extracted muscle synergy and synergy activation average vector of the 4 principal movements (PF, DF, IN, EV). The time-varying coefficients of the arbitrary muscle activation patterns were decomposed by revised NMF, fixing synergy vectors as the extracted muscle synergy from discrete movement trials during NMF iterations [37]. The same initialization and iteration protocols were utilized as those of muscle synergy extraction procedures for the rest of decomposition procedures. Given the revised NMF, the arbitrary muscle activation patterns can be reflected into the muscle synergy space of the discrete ankle and subtaric joint movements. This reflected time-varying coefficients at time \\(t\\), \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\), is further decoded into motor intents of ankle and subtaric movements by using the synergy activation vector of 4 discrete movements, \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PF}}\\), \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}\\), \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}\\), and \\(\\bm{u}_{\\text{EV}}\\), as\n\n\\[\\begin{split} a_{\\text{PFPF}}(t)&=\\frac{1}{\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PF}}^{T}\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}\\right)}\\left(\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{PP}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|} \\right)\\right.\\\\ &\\quad-\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{DP}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{ \\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|}\\right)\\right)\\end{split}\\] (4)\n\n\\[\\begin{split} a_{\\text{INEV}}(t)&=\\frac{1}{\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}^{T}\\bm{u}_{\\text{IF}}\\right)}\\left(\\text{ acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{IN}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|} \\right)\\right.\\\\ &\\quad-\\text{acos}\\left(\\bm{u}_{\\text{EV}}^{T}\\frac{\\bm{U}_{ \\text{S}}(t)}{\\|\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}(t)\\|}\\right)\\right)\\end{split}\\] (5)\n\nwhere \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) indicate directions of desired movements in ankle and subtaric DoF, respectively. Given these definitions, \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) ranges from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) and the \\(a\\)-space consists of \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\) served as a phase domain of motor control. The universal dimensionality of decomposed \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) was unified as 3, which was the dimensionality of decomposed \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) of all subjects in the BIO group. When fewer synergy vectors were identified previously by synergy extraction procedures, \\(\\bm{\\theta}\\) vectors were added in \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) to match dimensionality of vectors.\n\n**2-DoF motor controllability**. We quantified simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability by investigating the transitions in directionality of motor intent during 10 cycles of the drawing-a-circle tasks. First, the \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\) was reflected into \\(a\\)-space. To draw an ideal circle in joint space, the directionality of motor intent in both ankle and subtaric DoF needs to be changed simultaneously. This is equivalent to simultaneous changes in both \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) and \\(a_{\\text{PFPF}}\\). resulting in diagonal trajectory in \\(a\\)-space. Meanwhile, if the subject is only able to perform a single DoF motor control at a time, only changes in \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) or \\(a_{\\text{PPF}}\\) is found at a time. This is equivalent to a horizontal or vertical trajectory in \\(a\\)-space. Therefore, 2-DoF motor controllability was calculated by integrating diagonal components of trajectories within \\(a\\)-space to evaluate the simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability, or\n\n\\[\\begin{split} 2\\text{-DoF motor controllability}&=1-\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{4}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n_{i}}\\frac{1}{T_{E,i}^{i}-T_{S,i}^{i}}\\\\ &\\int_{T_{V_{i}}^{i}}^{T_{V_{i}}}\\text{acos}\\left(\\delta_{11} \\cdot\\frac{|\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}|}{\\|\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}\\|}\\right)dt\\end{split}\\] (6)\n\nwhere \\(n_{j}\\) is the number of trajectories in \\(j\\)-th quadrant of \\(a\\)-space; \\(T_{S,i}^{i}\\) and \\(T_{E,i}^{i}\\) indicate the start and end time of \\(i\\)th trajectory in \\(j\\)th quadrant, respectively; \\(\\dot{\\bm{\\alpha}}\\) and \\(\\dot{\\bm{\\delta}}_{11}\\) are a velocity vector in \\(a\\)-space and unit diagonal vector, given as \\([\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}]\\), respectively. The trajectories in \\(a\\)-space were evaluated by each quadrant independently to investigate multi-DoF motor controllability of different combinations of discrete movements. The average diagonal components of trajectories on each quadrant were computed and normalized by \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\). Finally, the mean values of diagonal components of all quadrants were calculated. If no full trajectories were present in a quadrant, it was considered as zero diagonal component for that quadrant. Note that the second term on the right-hand side of the equation converges to zero and 2-DoF motor controllability becomes 1 when all the trajectories in all quadrants are composed by only diagonal components. Thus, given this definition, 2-DoF motor controllability ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n**Evaluation of spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints**. Spatiotemporal motor control was evaluated from two metrics, motor control performance and economy of motion under increasing time constraints from 2.0 s to 1.5 s, 1 s, 0.8 s, and 0.5 s. For the visualization, an index of difficulty (ID) of speed-accuracy task for each time constraint (2.0-0.5 s) was calculated as the logarithm of the inverse of the time constraint and scaled to range from 0 to 1 (ID\\({}_{2.0}\\)-ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)), inspired by Fitts' law [38, 39, 40]. Speed-accuracy tasks comprised 10 repetitions in each of discrete PF, DF, IN, EV movements in a random order for each of 5 time-interval settings. The motor control performance was analyzed based on the tracking errors between the decoded motor intent \\(\\bm{\\alpha}\\), and ideal targets of \\(j\\) discrete movement \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{j}\\) in \\(a\\)-space, as\n\n\\[\\text{motor control performance}=1-\\frac{1}{2(T_{E}-T_{S})}\\int_{T_{S}}^{T_{E}}| \\chi_{j}-\\alpha(t)|dt.\\] (7)\n\nIdeal target movements in \\(a\\)-space \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{PP}}\\), \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{DP}}\\), \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{IN}}\\), and \\(\\bm{\\chi}_{\\text{EV}}\\) were defined as (0, \\(-1\\)), (0, 1), (\\(-1\\), 0), and (1, 0), respectively. Given this definition, the motor control performance shows how one can maintain motor intent corresponding to given motor tasks. Economy of motion was computed by the ratio of effective synergy activation for targeted \\(j\\) discrete movements to total synergy activation, or\n\n\\[\\text{economy of motion}=\\frac{1}{T_{E}-T_{S}}\\int_{T_{s}}^{T_{E}}\\frac{|\\bm{\\alpha} (t)|}{|\\bm{\\alpha}(t)|}dt\\] (8)\n\nwhere \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) is effective synergy activation for targeted \\(j\\) discrete movements, determined as \\(a_{\\text{PPF}}\\) for PF and DF and \\(a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) for IN and EV. Given this definition, the economy of motion indicates the trajectory straightness of movements that were produced to achieve the target discrete movements.\n\n**Assessment of phantom limb perception capacity**. A psychometric task was used to assess limb perception capacity of the phantom limbs across the full perceived ranges of motion (ROM) for DF-PF and IN-EV. The mirrored perceived phantom limb positions were measured by goniometry from the subjects' BIO limb and were normalized by the ROM of the BIO limb (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) to allow comparison when plotted against the intended phantom limb positions (\\(\\hat{\\theta}\\)) assessed from the EMG data. The intended limb position was assessed by the average value of \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\parallel a_{\\text{PFF}}\\) and \\(\\bm{U}_{\\text{S}}\\parallel a_{\\text{INEV}}\\) for each movement which show the both direction and amplitude of desired movements. To vary the phantom limb position while considering the range of motion of each joint, the subjects were guided to perform 25, 50, 75, and 100% PF and DF range of motion during separate, 40 randomized PF and DF trials, and 50 and 100% range of motion during 30 randomized IN and EV trials. The limb perception capacity was estimated based on the relationship between the intended phantom limb positions and the mirrored perceived phantom limb positions, determined as the mean value of the ranges between 5 and 95% of the psychometric functions. When a subject reported either zero phantom limb sensation or inconsistent phantom limb sensation tothe intended limb positions, the limb perception capacity was determined as zero. When 5 or 95% of the psychometric function was not reached, the minimum or maximum value of the psychometric function was selected.\n\n**Assessment of phantom limb sensations.** The reported phantom limb sensation scores focused on the vividness of their phantom limb sensations compared to actual sensations of their biologically intact limb during ankle, subtalar, and ankle/subtalar joint rotations. Subjects self-reported vividness of these phantom sensations on a scale of 0-to-10, where values of 0 and 10 respectively indicated no sensation or equivalent sensations for their phantom joint to their BIO limb. The full findings are given in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n**Statistics.** No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size a priori, but effect sizes were determined for the main outcomes using Cohen's \\(d\\) values between 1.26-to-1.35 (Supplementary Table 2). Data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments. The unaffected limbs of all subjects served as the biologically intact limb population when appropriate, thus no separate non-amputated subjects were recruited. In all experiments, except when specifically noted, the order of the motor control tasks was randomized as described in the relevant Methods sections and in the Nature Research Reporting Summary. Six sensory-motor response variables were correlated with the degree of AMS for the pooled dataset of all 14 subjects' residual limbs (CTL-1-7 and AMI-1-7). A non-parametric correlation, Kendall's tau (\\(\\tau\\)), and \\(P\\) value were computed to address a positive association between each response variable and the degree of AMS. A first order exponential response curve was fitted to address a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS\\)) that preserves 95% of each sensory-motor response variable. Jackknife mean \\(\\pm\\) standard deviation (s.d.) of \\(AMS\\), and \\(R^{2}\\) values of fitted response curve for each response variable were reported. The normality of the motor control data was tested by a Shapiro-Wilk test at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). To consider within-subject limb differences (AMI:BIO-A and CTL:BIO-C), paired one-tailed \\(t\\)-tests were used at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\), as all motor control data did not violate the data normality. To consider between-subject residual limb differences (AMI:CTL), unpaired two-tailed \\(t\\)-tests were used at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). Interactive effects between limb subgroups (AMI:CTL x affect-dunaffected limb) were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA at a significance level of \\(\\alpha=0.05\\). The full statistics are reported in the Supplementary Table 2.\n\n**Reporting summary.** Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Naturalness of motor control.** Varied motor control in biologically intact limbs is executed by the activation of combinations of muscle synergies (Fig. 2a) [28, 29, 30]. We evaluated the naturalness of motor control of amputees by computing similarities between muscle synergies and their activation profiles for residual limbs and biologically intact limbs. We used a linear synergy model to extract muscle synergy and activation profiles from recorded EMG using a dimensionality-reduction technique [28, 29, 30]. The subjects performed discrete ankle and subtalar motion tasks that were assigned in the chronological order of PF-IN-DF-EV, which was not randomized in an effort to identify existing muscle synergies for the 4 principal movements as accurately as possible for the forthcoming analyses. The extracted muscle synergies and average vectors of synergy activation profiles for all 28 limbs are shown in Fig. 2b, c, respectively. All BIO-A, BIO-C, AMI, and 4/7 CTL limbs indicated 3 muscle synergies performing 4 principal ankle and subtalar movements. All BIO and AMI limbs shared common muscle synergies; one synergy (\\(W_{1}\\)) was dominated by GA and TP muscle activations, and the other 2 synergies (\\(W_{2}\\) and \\(W_{3}\\)) were respectively dominated by PL and TA activations. However, muscle synergies were altered in 5/7 CTL limbs as follows: CTL-1-4 all differed from BIO limbs in \\(W_{2}\\) or \\(W_{3}\\), showing coactivation tendencies. CTL-2-4, and CTL-6 also differed from BIO limbs in \\(W_{1}\\), showing altered GA and TP coordination profiles (Supplementary Fig. 2b).\n\nThe muscle synergy similarity (m.s.s.) and synergy activation similarity (s.a.s.) between each subject's residual limb and the average profiles across all 14 subjects' biologically intact limbs was plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 2d, e). Both trends showed significant positive associations (m.s.s.: \\(\\tau=0.54\\), \\(P<0.01\\); s.a.s.: \\(\\tau=0.56\\), \\(P<0.005\\)). Relatively low values of the critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{c}\\)) were anticipated to preserve 95% of natural discrete motor control for the residual limb (m.s.s.: \\(AMS_{c}=0.21\\), \\(R^{2}=0.94\\); s.a.s.: \\(AMS_{c}=0.22\\), \\(R^{2}=0.84\\)). The results provide evidence in support of the degree of AMS within residual muscles enabling natural, discrete motor control.\n\nFurther analyses (Fig. 2f, g and Supplementary Table 2) found significant differences for AMI:CTL comparisons (m.s.: \\(t=3.30\\), \\(P<0.01\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=2.99\\), \\(P<0.02\\)), significant differences for CTL:BIO-C comparisons (m.s.s.: \\(t=3.37\\), \\(P<0.01\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=3.27\\), \\(P<0.01\\)), and no significant differences for AMI:BIO-A comparisons (m.s.: \\(t=0.48\\), \\(P=0.33\\), s.a.s.: \\(t=1.79\\), \\(P=0.06\\)). Further, subgroup analyses amongst the 28 limbs revealed significant interactive effects (AMI:CTL x affected:unaffected limb) for muscle synergy similarity and synergy activation similarity (m.s.: \\(F=10.68\\), \\(P<0.005\\), s.a.s.: \\(F=9.22\\), \\(P<0.01\\)). Together, the results suggest that advanced amputation procedures that actively preserve even a small degree of AMS may effectively preserve natural discrete motor control after amputation.\n\n**Robust multi-degrees-of-freedom motor control**. High reliability of motor control that is consistent and cohesive, even in the absence of visual or other functional feedback, is anticipated to provide stable neural signaling and thereby enable neuroprosthetic control. To assess robust motor control for ankle and subtalar joint movements, we investigated the variability in synergy activation profiles for each movement (Fig. 3a). Synergy activation profiles differed for different movement tasks. All BIO-A, BIO-C, and AMI limbs produced 4 distinct synergy activations for the ankle and subtalar joint movements (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 2b). In contrast, only 3/7 CTL limbs were able to produce 4 distinct synergy activations for ankle and subtalar movements.\n\nTo evaluate simultaneous multi-DoF motor controllability, we asked the subjects to attempt 'drawing a circle' with mirroring, of their phantom foot and biologically intact foot by simultaneously controlling their ankle and subtalar joints. We decoded the measured muscle activations into synergy activations (Fig. 3c, \\(U_{3}\\)) using the previously identified muscle synergies (\\(W_{1}\\)-\\(W_{1}\\)) and a matrix decomposition technique [37]. We then computed motor intents from the synergy activations based on the average vectors of synergy activation profiles of the 4 principal ankle and subtalar joint movements, transforming into the \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3). The \\(\\alpha\\)-space presents the directions of desired movements from the decoded synergy activations. When the circle is drawn with ankle and subtalar movement transitions in concert, the directionality of motor intents for ankle and subtalar joints changes simultaneously, resulting in diamond-type trajectories consisting of diagonals in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Fig. 3d, e). In contrast, single DoF motor control would be addressed as a change in either \\(\\alpha_{\\rm{PPPP}}\\) or \\(\\alpha_{\\rm{INEV}}\\), resulting in rectangle-type trajectories in \\(\\alpha\\)-space. Therefore, we quantified 2-DoF motor controllability of each limb by computing the mean value of the diagonal components of traces in \\(\\alpha\\)-space.\n\nThe 2-DoF motor controllability plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 3f) showed significant positive associations (\\(\\tau=0.58\\), \\(P<0.005\\)), and a relatively low \\(AMS_{c}\\) was anticipated to preserve 95% of 2-DoF motor controllability for the residual limb (\\(AMS_{c}=0.26\\), \\(R^{2}=0.89\\)). Significant interactive effects (Fig. 3g, F = 12,22, \\(P<0.005\\)) were found for 2-DoF motor controllability between amputation subgroup and limb category (AMI:CTL \\(\\times\\) affected-unaffected limb). Also, significant differences in 2-DoF motor controllability were found between CTL and BIO-C limbs (\\(t=3.25\\), \\(P<0.01\\)) and between AMI and CTL limbs (\\(t=3.42\\), \\(P<0.01\\)), whereas no significant difference was found between BIO-A and AMI limbs (\\(t=0.60\\), \\(P=0.28\\)).\n\nTogether, our results suggest that AMS within residual muscles enhances the decoupling and stabilization of the motor behaviors for discrete ankle and subtalar joint movements, allowing robust, simultaneous 2-DoF motor control of the residual limbs without visual or other functional feedback. Further, our results imply that amputation procedures that actively preserve biological AMS may effectively preserve multi-DoF motor control after amputation.\n\n### ", "Spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints": "\n\nWe investigated the impact of AMS within residual muscles on spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints through speed-accuracy motor tasks, also referred to as Fits' law-type motor tasks [38, 39, 40]. We imposed time constraints, of 2.0, 1.5, 1.0, 0.8, or 0.5 s, within which subjects were asked to perform the 4 discrete ankle and subtalar movements (Fig. 4a). For each time interval setting, PF, DF, IN, and EV movement tasks were presented in randomized order. Spatiotemporal motor control performance was quantified from errors between target motor tasks and decoded motor intents in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (Supplementary Fig. 4). An index of difficulty (ID) of this task was calculated for each time\n\nFigure 2: **Naturalness of motor control.** In **a**, the framework of muscle synergies is shown. Varied motor control is executed by the activation of combinations of muscle synergies. In **b**, the extracted muscle synergies of all 28 limbs including the affected limbs of 14 subjects who had undergone either an Agostar-antagonist Movement Interface (AMI) amputation or a non-AMI amputation (CTL), and their unaffected limbs (BIO) are shown (BIO: \\(n=14\\), AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). The muscle synergies were extracted from motor outputs of 4 muscles: the tibialis anterior (TA), tibialis posterior (TP), lateral gastrocnemius (GA), and peroneus longus (PL). In **c**, the average vectors of synergy activation profiles are shown. These vectors were derived from the muscle synergies found during discrete motion testing of all 28 limbs (BIO: \\(n=14\\), AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)).

In **d** and **e**, the relationships between muscle synergy similarity and synergy activation similarity are shown with the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(n=14\\)).

Conversely, CTL-2 could successfully perform the speed-accuracy motor task only if allowed a longer time interval (ID\\({}_{1.5}\\) or ID\\({}_{1.5}\\)) as evidenced by loss of the boundaries\n\nFig. 3: **Multi-degree-of-freedom motor control.** In **a**, representative data are plotted that were collected during testing of the 4 discrete movements, and an illustration of robustly distinct and fused synergy activation profiles are shown. Here, the four different colors indicate the movements of plantarflexion (PF, red), dorsflexion (DF, green), inversion (IN, blue), and aversion (EV, black). Each axis (\\(c_{1}\\)-\\(c_{2}\\)) indicates the activation of a muscle synergy (\\(\\textbf{W}_{1}\\)-\\(\\textbf{W}_{3}\\)).\n\nAgostriatal-magnositral Hyonverniel Interface (AMI); affected limbs of participants who underwent an AMI amputation (AMI-1-7); affected limbs of participants who underwent a Non-AMI control amputation (CTL-1-7); unaffected biologically-interact limbs (BIO-A1-7 and BIO-CI-7). In **b**, illustrations of the 4 discrete joint movements and the degree of decoupled motor behaviors are shown for synergy activation profiles of 14 subjects (AMI: \\(n=7\\), CTL: \\(n=7\\)). Shown in **c** are diagrams of the \\(\\alpha\\)-space transformation used to decode motor intention of an arbitrary motor output (\\(\\textbf{U}_{3}=[c_{1}\\), \\(c_{2}\\), \\(c_{3}\\))) from the average vectors of synergy activation profiles for the 4 discrete movements (\\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\text{MF}}\\)).

Motor control performance plotted against the degree of AMS showed significant positive associations (\\(\\tau=0.61\\pm 0.07\\), \\(P<0.01\\)) across all IDs (Fig. 4c, d). We further investigated the economy of motion through trajectory straightness of the performed synergy activations during targeted movement tasks. Economy of motion responses plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 4e, f) showed significant positive associations against AMS (\\(\\tau=0.49\\pm 0.02\\), \\(P<0.05\\)).\n\nOur results suggest that a higher degree of preserved AMS can provide a person with an amputation more sustained economy of motion, with minimized wasted movements, during spatiotemporal motor tasks. Conversely, a subject with limited AMS was less able to maintain efficacious motion and 'wanderd' more during spatiotemporal motor control performance tasks shown as a low economy of motion. We speculate that the afferent feedback inherent in residual limb AMS may reduce 'trembling' of neuroprosthetic control in the absence of visual or other functional\n\nFig. 4: **Spatiotemporal motor control under time constraints.** In **a**, an illustration is shown of a subject performing randomized, discrete ankle and subtlar joint motion tasks under varying time constraint (2-0.5 s), or index of difficulty (ID\\({}_{2.0}\\) - ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)). To decode motor intentions of recorded motor outputs, first, synergy activations (\\(\\varsigma_{1}\\)-\\(\\varsigma_{2}\\)) are calculated using the muscle synergies (\\(\\textbf{W}_{1}\\)-\\(\\textbf{W}_{2}\\)) previously identified during 4 discrete motion testing of plantarflexion (PF), dorsification (DF), inversion (IN), and aversion (EV). Finally, directionality of motor intentions in an ankle joint (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)) and subtlar joint (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)) are computed based on the average vectors of synergy activation profiles for the 4 discrete movements \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\), \\(\\textbf{u}_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\) and the synergy activation vector of recorded motor outputs (\\(\\textbf{U}_{5}\\) = [\\(\\varsigma_{1}\\), \\(\\varsigma_{2}\\), \\(\\varsigma_{3}\\))]. In **b**, motor control performance is shown for two representative subjects in \\(\\alpha\\)-space (\\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\) and \\(a_{\\mathrm{rOF}}\\)). The Agonist-antagonist Movement Interface (AMU) subject maintained all 4 discrete movements up to the highest difficulty level with time constraint (0.5 s, ID\\({}_{0.5}\\)). In contrast, the non-AMI control (CTL) subject started to lose boundaries at ID\\({}_{0.8}\\) and completely lost them at ID\\({}_{0.5}\\). Relationships are shown in **e** and **f** between the motor control performance and the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(\\tau=14\\)) at all IDs. Further, relationships are shown in **e** and **f** between the economy of motion and the degree of AMS using a similar combined analysis (\\(\\tau=14\\)). Motor control performance and the economy of motion were evaluated by the error and straightness of motor control traces to the target motor tasks. Kendall\u2019s tau coefficients (\\(\\tau\\)), \\(P\\), \\(R^{2}\\), and the Jackknife mean and s.d. of a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{\\varsigma}\\)) are reported.\n\n feedback to enable improved neuroprosthetic control, as will be further discussed in the ", "Discussion": " section.\n\n**Subject-specific proprioceptive limb perception**. After signals from sensory receptors involved in proprioception[1] exert a strong influence on both motor control[41] and proprioceptive limb perception[41, 42, 4]. If the degree of residual AMS is a critical neurophysiological determinant underlying natural motor control preservation after limb amputation, we postulate that AMS should also contribute to preserving proprioceptive phantom limb perception. To explore this experimentally, we asked the subjects to move and vary their phantom foot positions to 25, 50, 75, and 100% of their DF or PF range of motion, and to 50 and 100% of their IN or EV range of motion, while mirroring phantom limb perception with their biologically intact foot. We assessed the intended phantom limb positions (\\(\\theta\\)) from EMG as \\(\\bm{U}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\parallel\\alpha_{\\mathrm{FEDF}}\\) and \\(\\bm{U}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\parallel\\alpha_{\\mathrm{INV}}\\) which indicate both direction and amplitude of the desired movements (Fig. 5a). The measured mirrored perceived phantom limb position (\\(\\theta\\)) was accessed by goniometry and normalized by the range of motion of the BIO limb.\n\nWe estimated the values of limb perception capacity based on the psychometric function defined by plotting \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) against \\(\\theta\\) for each degree of freedom (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5). Data for three subjects--one who had undergone the AMI (AMI-1), another a traditional (CTL-3), and the other an osteomyelitismatic amputation[32, 33] (CTL-5) - are shown in Fig. 5a. AMI-1 exemplified high limb perception capacity (0.77) and a high capability to vary her phantom foot position. In contrast, CTL-3 demonstrated lower limb perception capacity (0.32) and restricted capability to vary the position of his phantom foot. Notably, CTL-5, who had undergone an Ertl ostemoplysmic amputation[32, 33], exhibited high limb perception capacity (0.60) and high capability to vary the position of his phantom foot. Consistently, when compared to the muscle dynamics presented\n\nFig. 5: **Subject-specific proprioceptive perception. In **a**, relationships are shown between the mirrored perceived phantom limb position as measured from the biologically-inter limb without visual feedback and the intended phantom limb positions for three representative subjects (AMI-1, CTL-3, and CTL-5), who had respectively undergone Ag Agnist-antagonist Movement Interface (AMI), traditional, and Ertl ostemoplysmic amputation procedures. Estimated limb perception capacity (Lp,c) is reported. In **b**, schematic diagrams are shown of the anticipated residual limb structures, based on ultrasonography, highlighting the dynamic AMI construct excursion in 2-Dof for AMI, restricted motion in control subjects (CTL-1, CTL-3, CTL-4, and CTL-6), and joystick-like\u2019 residual muscle coupling in control subjects (CTL-2, CTL-5, and CTL-7). Size and positioning of elements are representative and not to scale. In **c**, limb perception capacity of the phantom limb is plotted against the degree of agonist-antagonist muscle strain (AMS) in a combined analysis of affected AMI and CTL limbs (\\(n=14\\)). Kendall\u2019s tau correlation (r), \\(P,R^{2}\\), and the Jackknife mean and s.d. of a critical degree of AMS (\\(AMS_{c}\\)) are reported. The limb perception capacity for AMI-2 and CTL-2 (encircled) deviated from the trend.\n\n by AMI-1, CTL-3, and CTL-5, the ultrasound examination of CTL-5 revealed 2-DoF 'joystick-like' coupling between antagonistic muscle pairs that were distributed across the inferior aspect of his residual limb, as illustrated in the comparison shown in Fig. 5b.\n\nLimb perception capacity plotted against the degree of AMS (Fig. 5c) showed a significant positive association (\\(\\tau=0.58\\), \\(P<0.005\\)) across all 14 residual limbs. However, the \\(AMS_{c}\\) value was higher (\\(AMS_{c}=0.61\\), \\(R^{2}=0.45\\)) compared with the values of \\(AMS_{c}\\) identified to preserve natural muscle synergy, synergy activation similarity, and 2-DoF motor controllability (\\(AMS_{c}\\) ranged from 0.21-to-0.26). Our results suggest that subject-specific limb perception capacity is impacted by the degree of preserved residual muscle AMS after limb amputation. Our results further imply that a higher degree of preserved AMS within residual muscles may be required to preserve proprioceptive limb perception compared to the degree required to preserve biomimetic motor control. AMI-2 and CTL-2 (encircled, Fig. 5c), who deviated from the trend, reported no functional range of motion prior to their amputations during which time both experienced severe pain with attempted joint movements, as will be further discussed in the Discussion section.\n\n**Supplemental clinical metrics.** We have gathered and analyzed clinical metrics including correlations between time since amputation and sensory-motor responses, maximum EMG values, average cross section of scar tissue, and average phantom limb score (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 1). No significant correlations, positive or negative, were found between muscle synergy similarity (AMI: \\(P=0.91\\), CTL: \\(P=0.42\\)), synergy activation similarity (AMI: \\(P=0.15\\), CTL: \\(P=0.25\\)), 2-DoF motor controllability (AMI: \\(P=0.33\\), CTL: \\(P=0.46\\)), or limb perception capacity (AMI: \\(P=0.11\\), CTL: \\(P=0.89\\)) and time since amputation for the 14 residual limbs. Also, no significant differences between the AMI and CTL subjects were seen in the maximum EMG values recorded from the four target muscles (TA: \\(t=1.41\\), \\(P=0.18\\), TP: \\(t=-0.30\\), \\(P=0.77\\), GA: \\(t=1.49\\), \\(P=0.16\\), PL: \\(t=-0.74\\), \\(P=0.48\\)), average scar tissue cross-sectional area (\\(t=0.11\\), \\(P=0.91\\)), quantified with ultrasonography[43], or average phantom limb pain score (\\(t=2.08\\), \\(P=0.06\\)).\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this study, we have accumulated evidence that, for the specific free space motor tasks performed, the degree of AMS within residual limb muscles postamputation is the neuromechanical determinant underlying the large variability observed in subject-specific motor control and perception. Our work supports the hypothesis that preservation of transtibial residual-limb AMS can restore sensorimotor capacity postamputation.\n\nThe single metric, AMS, a characteristic residual-limb structural feature, enabled the correlation of 6 types of sensorimotor responses from 14 transtibial amputee participants. Not unexpectedly, residual limb AMS and sensorimotor responses were individuated amongst the 14 participants, spanning a broad range of ages, times since amputation, surgical procedures, and etiologies. It was therefore remarkable that, despite this inherent intrasubject variability, residual limb AMS was found to impact motor control and perception as an exponential response. The gradual and monotonic improvements with the degree of preserved AMS underscore the importance of surgical amputation strategies like the AMI that preserve AMS.\n\nBecause muscle synergies and proprioceptive limb perception are organized at the central nervous system (CNS) level[26, 28, 44], the critical level of AMS identified in the exponential response implies CNS sensitivity to modified AMS in preserving motor control and perception. This CNS sensitivity to modified AMS may be critical to understanding and predicting outcomes of advanced surgical augmentation strategies for motor control and proprioceptive perception. The \\(AMS_{c}\\) for muscle synergy, synergy activation similarity, and 2-DoF motor controllability range was 0.21-0.26, which predicts that about 21-26% AMS preservation will induce 95% preservation of natural motor control for discrete and multi-DoF movements. The finding that the \\(AMS_{c}\\) for phantom limb perception capacity was relatively high (0.61) suggests a higher degree of afferent signaling from AMS may be involved in the context of proprioceptive memory modulation[45, 46, 47, 4] compared to that required to preserve motor control. As a consequence of the difference in \\(AMS_{c}\\) for motor control versus proprioceptive percepts, subjects with an AMS preservation value close to the 21-26% range demonstrated a natural level of motor control but yet exhibited a limited degree of proprioceptive percepts. Such was the case for study participants AMI-3, AMI-7, CTL-5, and CTL-7 with AMS values equal to 19.2, 26.4, 23.2, and 23.8%, respectively.\n\nMuscle synergies in non-amputated humans reflect reflexive and afferent neural feedback in a manner dictated by muscul-lorendon length changes and joint biomechanics[48]. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first to address the relationships between residual muscle biomechanics and muscle synergies in persons with major limb amputation. Together, our results suggest that AMS can provide a characteristic, readily ascertainable residual limb structural feature that can help to explain the variability in amputation outcomes and contribute together with other non-AMS factors including neuroplasticity, proprioceptive memory, neural signaling deficits, subject-specific perceptive responses, differences in scar tissue formation postamputation, and other biomechanical factors within the limb.\n\nIn this study, we address the beneficial outcomes of surgical paradigms that can actively preserve AMS during transtibial amputation. AMS preservation may also improve motor control and proprioceptive percepts for patients who undergo amputations at other anatomical levels. The AMI amputation procedure has now been conducted on over 30 patients at the transtibial, transfemoral, transradial and transhumeral levels to enable improved motor control and sensory perception in a broader population of amputee subjects[49]. When musculature distal to the amputation level is intact and viable, it may be harvested on a neurovascular leash during the amputation procedure, and AMS preservation can then be surgically implemented through muscle pair coupling and mechanical fixation of the construct to the surrounding fascia and muscle within the residuum[15, 50]. If musculature distal to the amputation level is not viable, then AMS preservation may be implemented by constructing a native AMI using large vascularized muscle with TMR nerve reintervention[15], or alternatively by constructing a regenerative AMI from reinervated muscle grafts[15, 51].\n\nIn some instances, it may not be feasible to surgically implement all agonist-antagonist muscle couplings to fully emulate intact-limb dynamics due to limited physical volume of the residuum skin envelope (e.g., in a transradial amputation). In this case, the AMI procedure may be applied to only major agonist-antagonist muscle pairs while other surgical strategies such as rPNI and TMR are applied to the remaining musculature sites and transacted nerves. Thus, through an integration of AMI, rPNI, and TMR techniques, the amputation procedure can be designed to improve motor control and sensory perception for patient-specific functional limb restoration[15]. Another consideration is operative time; AMS preservation during amputation requires a somewhat extended operation time[52, 5, 2], and as such may not be appropriate in some scenarios. In other cases, such as life-threatening emergencies, AMS may be excluded initially and introduced during a revision surgery, which is often performed to treat phantom limb pain or neuromon postamputation [20].\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate the benefits of preserving AMS on motor control and sensory perception in free space using a synergy analysis that did not require a physical external prosthesis or a specific control system. In the EMG control of external powered prostheses, a critical challenge is the surface EMG electrodes needed for neuroprosthetic applications. Various research groups and companies are developing flexible, thin electrodes [53, 54] for in-socket EMG recordings from residual muscles. We developed and investigated film-thick electrodes [54] and a neuroprosthesis [55], with which we are exploring AMI amputee subjects' capabilities for level ground walking and terrain adaptation. We are also integrating AMI constructs with an osseintegration implant, wherein a bone-anchored mechanical conduit can allow percutaneous passage of 16 implanted leads for electrical stimulation of, and recording from, an amputee subject's residuum muscles [56]. In this approach implanted EMG electrodes are placed onto each AMI muscle with each electrode's wire leads passing through the osseointegrated implant.\n\nIn this study, we present a platform that combines muscle synergy analysis with biophysical and biomedical sciences to clinically demonstrate the impact of AMS on physiological motor control after limb amputation in 14 amputee subjects. Naturalness of motor control is investigated using the extracted muscle synergies and their activation profiles. Our approach reveals that preserving a relatively low degree of AMS in the residuum (20-26% of that in a biologically intact limb) is effective in preserving natural motor control postamptation, though preserving limb perception capacity requires a higher degree (61%) of AMS preservation. Our findings suggest that AMS-amputation strategies are one way to enable more effective and biomimetic sensorimotor control postamptation. Previously, the reasons underlying motor control and proprioceptive perception postamptation were poorly understood. The unique circumstances of our study population and dataset, which comprises 28 AMI and CTL limbs - their post-amputation residual limbs and biologically intact limbs--allowed the discovery of a fundamental index. The present approach provides a predictive index of postamptation outcome, \\(AMS_{\\infty}\\) derived through a combination of mathematical, biomechanical, and clinical data. Consequently, our findings offer new, meaningful insights into motor and sensory perturbations by people living with major limb amputation. With further refinement, the concept of a critical degree of AMS may elucidate fundamental factors underlying clinical outcomes after amputation and inform future amputation paradigms and neuroprosthetic system designs.\n\nFor the motor tasks performed, our study provided evidence to support the hypothesis that the degree of AMS within the transibial residuum is the neuromechanical determinant of subject-specific motor control and proprioceptive preservation. The main limitation of our study was its small population size--14 transibial amputees including 7 AMI and 7 non-AMI participants. We anticipate that future, larger studies will further elucidate the correlations established herein and provide further insight into how a multiplicity of factors such as age, time since amputation, body habitus, and amputation etiology may impact sensorimotor responses.\n\nEmulating the natural biomechanics of muscle interaction to impart a high degree of AMS in residual limbs requires a sophisticated surgical design. Surgical considerations include physiological muscle tensions in mechanical couplings, balanced muscle force capacities, and minimizing the mechanical impedance to enable freely moving agonist-antagonist muscle dynamics. In practice, taking these multiple factors into account during the amputation procedure is challenging. In this study, the large variance in AMS across the AMI cohort underscores the need for further optimization of AMI amputation technique to enable a more consistent AMS clinical outcome. More broadly, an exciting area of future research would be the development of residual limb architectures that enable direct computer control of mechano-neural transduction [49]. To this end, basic research advances are necessary in physiological actuators such as biocompatible synthetic actuators [57], intramuscular sensors [60, 58, 59, 70], and stimulators that can be implanted in series with residual muscle end organs.\n\nThe importance of mechanoeueral transduction within sensory organs for afferent signaling is well known [2, 4]. However, the motor control consequences of altered afferent signals by the macroscale reconfiguration of biomechanically-functional tissue architectures is not yet understood. Here we document the effects of modified afferent signaling from distinct functional tissue architectures of the transibial residuum by revealing the neuromechanical determinant, and the sensitivity of its impact on the CNS, to subject-specific residual motor control and phantom limb perception. Toward the design of biomimetic neural interfaces, we wish to underscore the value of surgical techniques that create a residuum tissue structure that preserves natural neuromuscular and biomechanical function.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nAll data associated with this study are found in the main text and the Supplementary Materials.

Since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was first detected on the island in March of 2020, it spread rapidly though the island's population and became a critical threat to public health.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a genomic surveillance study through a partnership with health agencies and academic institutions to understand the emergence and molecular epidemiology of the virus on the island. We sampled COVID-19 cases monthly over 19 months and sequenced a total of 753 SARS-CoV-2 genomes between March 2020 and September 2021 to reconstruct the local epidemic in a regional context using phylogenetic inference.\n\nResultsOur analyses reveal that multiple importation events propelled the emergence and spread of the virus throughout the study period, including the introduction and spread of most SARS-CoV-2 variants detected world-wide. Lineage turnover cycles through various phases of the local epidemic were observed, where the predominant lineage was replaced by the next competing lineage or variant after -4 months of circulation locally. We also identified the emergence of lineage B.1.588, an autochthonous lineage that predominated in Puerto Rico from September to December 2020 and subsequently spread to the United States.\n\nConclusionsThe results of this collaborative approach highlight the importance of timely collection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data to inform public health responses.\n\n\n\n## Article\n\n* [1] The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was initially declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 [12]. Despite global efforts to interrupt transmission chains with quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions at the onset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the globe, creating a global pandemic and threat to human health worldwide. By November 15th, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 253 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in 222 countries and over 5 million deaths [3, 4]. SARS-CoV-2 reached all 50 states of the United States and associated territories, including Puerto Rico, by March 2020, after multiple introductions by travelers with infection [5, 6, 7]. The rapid spread across the United States was primarily propelled by interstate transmission chains and air travel to the associated territories [8, 9, 6].\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of \\(\\sim\\)30,000 base pairs. During replication, a virus-encoded endonuclease provides a proof-reading activity that contributes to the observed low mutation rate and stable genome [10, 11]. Nevertheless, the unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally and the wealth of genomic sequence data available through the international initiative for genomic studies and surveillance has facilitated phylodynamic approaches to infer viral evolutionary rate, growth rate, and the estimated time of origin for specific outbreaks [11]. Studies have revealed that the viral genome has been accumulating mutations of concern, especially in the spike protein region, which confer phenotypes with increased fitness and pathogenicity [12, 13, 14]. Increased infectivity, resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy and evasion of the immune response were among the most frequently observed phenotypes attributed to WHO-monitored variants; these phenotypes often dominated transmission and replacement of other lineages upon emergence [15, 16, 17, 18]. The Variant Being Monitored (VBM) B.1.1.7 (Alpha) was first identified in the United States in late December 2020 and was then characterized by a considerable increase in COVID-19 incidence associated with increased infectivity and occasionally more severe disease manifestations that increased hospitalization rates [19, 20]. Alpha became the dominant variant, especially in Europe and the United States, until the emergence of Variant of Concern (VOC) B.1.617.2/AY.x (Delta), first identified in the United States in May 2021, which developed into a prominent variant with an apparent higher virulence and pathogenic phenotype [21, 22, 23]. Because of the potential for increased transmissibility, morbidity mortality, and decreased efficacy of vaccines and other intervention strategies, monitoring the spread of variants (VBMs and VOCs) rapidly became a public health concern and priority [24, 25].\n\nPuerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, is a densely populated island and a popular tourist destination located in the Caribbean basin. SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Puerto Rico on March 13th, 2020, in two European travelers who arrived on a cruise ship and in one local resident who had close contact with family members with recent travel history. Additional travel-related and local cases were confirmed within the following weeks [26]. In response to the emerging threat, the government of Puerto Rico executed the most restrictive (compared to the United States) national stay-at-home order on March 15th, 2020, to mitigate transmission while preparing the public health infrastructure for the imminent impact [27, 28]. Travel restrictions imposed by the United States during the initial pandemic minimized international traffic to Puerto Rico, although domestic travel from the United States continued. Puerto Rico represents a unique epidemiologic setting in a geographically isolated location (an island), but with a regular influx of travelers mostly from the United States. This is an ideal setting to monitor introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants and answer questions to help inform SARS-CoV-2 spread and disease prevention strategies. Puerto Rico's public health response incorporated extensive molecular surveillance to the increased capacity, which presented a unique opportunity to study the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variant turnover, local dissemination, and evolution during a period of changing epidemiology and public health responses.\n\nIn response to the impending local epidemic, we established a partnership with the local health authorities and academia to conduct a genomic surveillance initiative to sample complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 across the island through time, monitor lineage circulation, and understand the genomic epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. This report presents the results from 19 months of genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analyses, which identified multiple introduction events that propelled the rapid expansion and persistent transmission of the virus on the island and lead to the establishment of an autohthonous lineage between August 2020 and January 2021.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Epidemiological data\n\nWe retrieved the number COVID-19 cases reported by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) from March 2020 to 30 September 2021 from the PRDH database dashboard on 1 December 2021 available here https://covid19datos.salud.gov.pr/. The collection of cases includes cases classified as confirmed (by molecular tests) or probable (by antigen tests) and plotted by date of sample collection.\n\n### Patient sample selection\n\nNasopharyngeal swab samples pre-selected for genomic surveillance were received from COVID-19 passive surveillance conducted by PRDH, the Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU), and hospital-based acute febrile illness surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dengue Branch. A total of 785 samples were collected from March 2020 to September 30th, 2020, from the seven health regions of the island, including 63 out of the 78 municipalities, and selection criteria included all samples with SARS-CoV-2 detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral load (CT \\(<\\) 28) and sufficient residual sample volume stored at \\(-80\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolC}\\) [29]. All samples were de-linked from patient identifiable information and processed under the guidelines approved by the CDC and Ponce School of Medicine institutional review boards (IRB) protocol 6731, which waived the need for informed consent for sequencing of residual samples.\n\n### Lineage frequency analysis\n\nThe frequency of SARS-CoV-2 lineage detection in Puerto Rico was calculated using the total number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org) with collection dates ranging between March 1st, 2020 and September 30th, 2021. All complete genome sequences and metadata were retrieved from the GISAID database as of October 31st, 2021. The dataset was filtered for complete genome data, high-coverage data, and complete collection date for a final dataset of 2514 entries. Lineage assignment on GISAID was determined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (Pangolin) [30, 31]. R with ggplot package was used to calculate lineage frequency and the graph focusing on the following lineages of interest: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), \\(\\mathrm{P_{1}}+\\mathrm{P_{1}}\\).1 (Gamma), B.1.588, Delta (B.1.6172.+AY.x), \\(\\mathrm{B.14.27}+\\mathrm{B.14.29}\\) (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.621/1 (Mu), and all other Pangolin-designated B lineages grouped as Other. No genomes collected in May 2020 have been published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021.\n\n\n\n**Complete genome sequencing and assembly**. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were generated directly from clinical nasopharyngeal samples. Viral RNA was extracted from viral transport media using the automated MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche) with the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral Nucleic Acid Small Volume Kit (Roche) following manufacturer-recommended protocols for 0.2 mL sample input volume and 0.1 mL RNA elution volume. MP96 external lysis buffer was used to pre-treat the samples for neutralization and assist the lysis process. First strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermofisher), and tiling PCR amplicons were generated using Q5* high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the ARTIC nCoV-2019 V3 primer scheme purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/blob/master/primer_schema/nCoV-2019/V3/nCov-2019.tsv). Candidate samples for sequencing presented clearly visible bands of target size (-400 bp) in DNA gel electrophoresis for both primer pools. PCR products were purified with AMTure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using Qubit 4.0 fluorometric (Thermofisher), DNA libraries were generated using the NEENext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs), reducing all reagents volumes to 25% from the manufacturer's recommended protocol to increase throughput. The resulting products were screened for size and quality using the Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies) and quantified with Qubit 4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher). Qualifying libraries were pooled and run in the MiSeq sequencer instrument (Illumina) using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 in 600-cycle program.\n\nThe resulting sequence reads were screened for quality, trimmed, and assembled into complete consensus SARS-CoV-2 genomes using the Genome Detective Virus Tool v1.136[32] (https://www.genomedetective.com) and assembly confirmed with iVar[33]. The Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used for lineage assignment[44] (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io). A total of 753 samples were sequenced with more than 95% genome coverage at a minimum of 10x sequence depth. All sequence data obtained for this study was submitted to GISAID, accession numbers available in Supplementary Data 1.\n\n**Phylogenetic analysis**. Our Puerto Rico SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset was analyzed against a diverse panel of genomes from across the world which provide regional phylogenetic context. Initially, we downloaded the Genomic Epidemiology metadata package for all entries from GISAID on August 18th, 2021 to screen genomes for subsampling. However, due to the large number of genomes available in GISAID, we downloaded and combined the following pre-sampled datasets for regional studies: NextRegion-North America, NextRegion-South America, and NextRegion-Global. We then used the standard ncov augur/auspic multiple input workflow available in the Nextstrain platform[35] (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov) to subsample contextual genomes and phylogenetic inference with time-stamped trees. The custom subsampling scheme program selected 2611 contextual genomes from the United States, North America, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, with higher proportions from The Americas and selected based on collection dates and genetic proximity to our Puerto Rico dataset. The combined dataset of 3364 genomes was aligned using MAFFT[36] and a global maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference was reconstructed with IQ-TREE[37]. The ncov workflow then transferred the ML tree to TreeTime[38] for time calibration and ancestral state reconstruction of the tree topology at constant rate of 8\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-4}\\) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The resulting global ML tree was visualized with Nextstrain auspice[35] and annotated with iTol for region of origin and emerging variants[39]. Subsampling from the Genomic Epidemiology metadata package retrieved in August and from the combined NextRegions produced phylogenetic trees with similar topologies. A list of all the sequences used in this study, including sequence labels and authors can be found in the \"Data availability\" section.\n\nSelected lineages of interest were studied further by reconstruction of phylogenetic focus trees. For the B.1.588 lineages-focused tree, we selected all B.1.588 genomes published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021. Contextual B.1 lineage genomes were selected based on phylogenetic clustering near the base of the B.1.588 clade in the global tree and by temporal proximity to the date range of B.1.588 circulation between June 2020 and January 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 239 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting tree topology and node support were compared to Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstruction using BEAST v1.10.4[40]. Briefly, we used time-calibrated genomes trimmed to coding sequence with sample collection dates and the nucleotide substitution model parametrized using Yang96 model under strict molecular clock, and Bayesian Skyline coalescent model. Markov chains were run for a total of 100 million steps with sampling every 10,000 steps in the chain. Run results were evaluated in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to ensure stationary parameters with statistical errors reflected in 95% highest probability density ranges with effective sample size (ESS) higher than 200 for each tree prior. MCC trees were generated in TreeAnnotator from BEAST package after discarding 10% of runs as burn-in. The resulting ML and MCC trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nFor the B.1.1.7 (Alpha VDM) lineage-focused tree, we selected all B.1.1.7 + Q.x designated genomes from the global tree and supplemented the dataset with additional B.1.1.7 + Q.x genomes from Puerto Rico and the United States to understand the lineage emergence and spread in the island. A custom subsampling scheme was selected on the Nextstrain now workflow to select genomes from samples collected between November 1st, 2020 and February 28th, 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 729 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting ML tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nFor the B.1.617.2 (Delta VOC) lineage-focused tree, we selected all B.1.617.2 + _AY.x_ designated genomes from the global tree and supplemented the dataset with additional B.1.617.2 + _AY.x_ genomes from Puerto Rico to understand lineage spread and sublineage clustering patterns across the island. The genome selector Python script designed by Anderson Brito (https://github.com/andersonbrito/ncov) was used to select additional Delta-designed genomes from Puerto Rico with collection dates range from June 1st, 2021 to September 30th, 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 815 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting ML tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nThe date of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) determined by the Nextstrain ML phylogenetic inference was confirmed with Bayesian coalescent analyses for B.1.588, Alpha VBM and Delta VOC lineage trees. Due to the large size of the datasets, each focus tree was reduced by tree-pruning to datasets with \\(<\\)150 genomes. tMRCA analyses were performed with BEAST v1.10.4 under a strict molecular clock fixed at 8\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-4}\\) substitutions per site per year and 150 million Markov chains sampling every10,000 steps. Results were evaluated in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) for convergence and ESS >200.\n\n**Reporting summary**. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Local epidemic and variant detection**. During March-July 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases remained low, associated with the strict stay-at-home order. After the order was lifted in June 2020, the number of cases increased steeply during the summer of 2020, initiating the local epidemic (Fig. 1a). Since then, we observed three epidemic waves with high points in November 2020, April 2021, and August 2021. By September 30th, 2021, the Puerto Rico Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 181,599 confirmed cases[26].\n\nWe conducted genomic surveillance for 19 months since March 2020, where, each month, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from recently symptomatic and asymptomatic patients residing in 63 of the 78 municipalities, covering all seven health regions of the island. The frequency of lineages detected was calculated periodically from all viral genomic sequences from Puerto Rico published in GISAID, including our sequence datasets, and reported to the PRDH to inform case investigations and surveillance (Fig. 1b). Our data comprise the genomes from the initial SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections detected in March 2020, which included three European tourists that arrived on the island in a cruise ship and eight residents with no recent travel history declared. PANGO lineage assignment after sequencing identified lineage A.1, a lineage predominant in Europe at the time, in the three travelers with infection, while lineages B.1 and B.1.1 were identified in residents with infection. B.1x lineages predominated in the United States and the Americas. The initial phase of the epidemic was characterized by the detection of a wide diversity of B.1x lineages that circulated at low frequency for short periods of time, suggesting that the local epidemic was initiated by multiple introduction events. In August 2020, we detected the emergence of lineage B.1.588 in various municipalities of the island. Lineage B.1.588 rapidly became the predominant lineage in Puerto Rico, circulating at high frequency for \\(\\sim\\)4 months and causing the first epidemic wave in November 2020 (Fig. 1a, b). Circulation of lineage B.1.588 declined during the first wave of the epidemic in the winter of 2020, a season of local holiday festivities and frequent travel. During this season, the diversity of B.1x lineages increased, and the first emergent variants were detected in the island, VBM B.1427/429 (Epsilon) in December 2020 and Alpha in January 2021 concordant to variant emergence in the United States (Fig. 1b). Concurrently, the first stage of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Puerto Rico started in mid-December 2020 for the elderly population and first responders. A steep reduction in confirmed cases was observed in the following months despite the introduction of VBMs B.1.526 (Iota) and P.1/1.1 (Gamma) in February and March 2021 respectively and the predominant circulation of Alpha in March 2021 (Fig. 1b). The second wave of the epidemic was observed in April 2021 with Alpha predominating (Fig. 1a, b). Though other emerging variants continued to be detected, the frequency of detection remained low, and Alpha predominated for \\(\\sim\\)3-4 months. The second stage of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign started in April 2021 for all adults and was immediately followed by a sharp decrease in confirmed cases, a period in which \\(\\sim\\)50% of the population had received at least one dose of the vaccine[26] (Fig. 1a). VOC B.1.617.2/AY.x (Delta) was first detected in June 2021, concordant with the emergence in the United States, and rapidly dominated transmission. During the same period, we detected the emergence of VBM B.1.621 (Mu), which caused a small local outbreak in the western part of the island, as well as a modest increase in Gamma infections (Fig. 1b). The third epidemic wave was observed in August 2021, coinciding with a summer of increased travel and the removal of local government-imposed restrictions on business indoor occupant capacity and public gatherings (Fig. 1a, b). During this period, most COVID-19 cases in Puerto Rico were caused by Delta and \\(\\sim\\)18 Delta sub-lineages were detected in the island, with AY.3 as the most frequently sampled sub-lineage (Fig. 1c). These data provide further evidence of the multiple importations received during this period of the epidemic. By September 30th, 2021, a steep decrease in confirmed cases was observed, a point in which more than 77% of the population had received at least one dose of the vaccine (Fig. 1a).\n\n**Phylogenetic reconstruction of the local pandemic**. This study generated 753 complete genomes from viruses sampled between March 2020 and September 2021. Our dataset was combined with 2611 publicly available genomes in GISAID to understand the emergence and spread of the viruses circulating in Puerto Rico in a global context. We reconstructed the local and regional epidemic using a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree inferred with maximum likelihood (Fig. 2). This global phylogenetic analysis estimated that the initial SARS-CoV-2 introductions occurred between February 19 and March 16, 2020. Most viral genomes from Puerto Rico descend or are closely related to genomes from the United States. However, we were unable to determine the precise origin at the state level due to the limited sampling during the emergence period and subsequent low circulation. The resulting tree topology inferred viral sequences from Puerto Rico scattered across the global tree, smaller short-lived monophyletic clusters, and larger monophyletic clusters that suggest sustained transmission of a particular genotype. Our analysis also showed the emergence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in Puerto Rico. Multiple monophyletic clusters of Puerto Rico sequences were inferred within the clades formed by each emergent variant and the size of the clades is proportional to the frequency of genomes sampled in the island (Figs. 1b and 2). The observed clustering patterns in the phylogenetic trees and the rapid increase in frequency following initial detection indicate multiple virus introductions with swift expansion across the island in a short period of time.\n\n**Detection and spread of autochthonous lineage B.1.588**. During the initial phase of epidemic transmission, we detected the emergence of an autochthonous lineage, B.1.588, which rapidly spread across the island. Based on GISAID data and co-lineages.org reports (https://cov-lineages.org/lineages), lineage B.1.588 was first detected in Puerto Rico on August 2nd, 2020: sequence EPI_ISL_1168693. Initially, lineage B.1.588 calculated only in Puerto Rico, accounting for approximately half of the viruses sampled in the island in September 2020. B.1.588 quickly became the predominant lineage in Puerto Rico during the first epidemic wave, circulating for 4 months until it was replaced by the emergence of Alpha in January 2021 (Fig. 1b). This study sequenced 97 out of the 115 B.1.588 genomes from Puerto Rico found in GISAID. To understand the emergence and spread of this lineage, we reconstructed a focused phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference with 103 B.1.588 sequences from Puerto Rico, 58 B.1.588 sequences from the United States and an additional set of 77 B.1 lineage sequences closely related to B.1.588 (Fig. 3). Our analysis estimated that lineage B.1.588 diverged from its parental lineage B.1 between May 21st, 2020, and July 16th, 2020 in Puerto Rico, after the appearance of two non-conservative mutations: T20I in the spike protein and M234I in the nucleocapsid protein. Subsequently, lineage B.1.588 spread broadly to the United States, mainly in New York, Texas, Florida, and California, where it circulated until May 2021 concomitant with a diversity of other lineages and variants. More than 990 B.1.588 genomes have been reported in the United States.\n\n**Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.** VBM Alpha was first detected in Puerto Rico in January 2021, co-circulating with local predominant lineage B.1.588 and other B lineages at a lower rate (Fig. 1b). Notably, this VBM replaced the well-established autofluorescence-thtonous lineage B.1.588. The emergence and epidemiology of Alpha in Puerto Rico resembled the patterns observed in the United States, with rapid spread and a sharp increase in confirmed cases [19, 20, 41]. To understand the emergence and spread of Alpha in Puerto Rico, we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic-focused tree with all Alpha genomes obtained in our dataset in addition to a subset of other Alpha genomes from Puerto Rico, the United States, and a regional context backdrop (Fig. 4). The resulting inference estimated that the emergence of Alpha in Puerto Rico may have occurred between November 6th, 2020, and December 31st, 2020. Tree topology showed multiple monophyletic clusters of Puerto Rican sequences diverging across a period of 4-5 months of circulation. The larger clusters of Puerto Rican sequences suggest that local transmission of specific Alpha genotypes was sustained, succeeding after multiple introduction events. Most of these clusters were associated with sequences from the United States, suggesting that multiple introductions occurred over a period of 5-6 months, propelling the local transmission of this variant. We also found a subset of Puerto Rican sequences associated with sequences from the Caribbean and the Americas but low node support impaired resolution of transmission patterns.\n\nVOC Delta was first detected in Puerto Rico in June 2021, during a period when SARS-CoV-2 transmission was declining,\n\nFig. 1: **Epidemiology and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage turn-over in Puerto Rico.** a Graphical representation of the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by antigen tests (light blue) and molecular tests (dark blue) reported by the PROH from March 2020 to September 30th, 2021, shown as a 21-day rolling average.

The phylogenetic tree is rooted in Wuhan/ WH0/2019 and Wuhan/Hu-V/2019 reference genomes.\n\n and the vaccination campaign was progressing rapidly (Fig. 1a, b). After its initial detection, Delta spread rapidly across the island (Fig. 1b). Over 30% of the COVID-19 cases sampled and sequenced in June 2021 were caused by Delta. This variant has been characterized broadly as the most dominant emerging variant, replacing most lineages, and causing most of COVID-19 cases in the United States and Puerto Rico from its emergence through November 2021. To understand the rapid emergence and spread of Delta in the island, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic-focused tree with all Delta Puerto Rican sequences obtained in our dataset supplemented with additional sequences from Puerto Rico and the United States retrieved from GISAID with collection dates between May 1st, 2021, and September 30th, 2021. According to our phylogenetic inference, the emergence of Delta in Puerto Rico may have occurred between April 15th and June 14th, 2021, potentially after one or multiple introductions. The precise origin of the introductions was challenging to resolve, considering that multiple sequences from Mexico, the United States, and the Caribbean cluster among the early sampled sequences from Puerto Rico with low node support, <75% bootstrap value (Fig. 5). The first Delta lineage to be detected was B.1.617.2, which seems directly related to a small number of VBM B.1.617.1 (Kappa) that clustered basal to the focused tree. Tree topology is similar to the patterns observed in the Alpha focus tree, where more than 17 distinct clusters with sequences from Puerto Rico were observed diverging across 4 months of circulation in the island. Most of these clusters were associated with distinct Delta sub-lineages and seem closely related to similar sequences from the United States and the Caribbean. These clustering patterns and the diversity of Delta sub-lineages detected suggest that multiple introductions throughout 5-6 months propelled the emergence and transmission of this variant in the island.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDespite initial containment of COVID-19 cases in the spring of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 subsequently spread rapidly across the island propelled by multiple introductions and extensive intra-island transmission. Our partnership responded rapidly with the launch of this collaborative study aimed at enhancing the local capacity for genomic surveillance, understanding the development of the epidemic, and tracking viral lineages of public health concern. Our efforts also led to the early identification and tracking of most of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of lineages circulating in the island; information that was reported monthly to the Puerto Rico Department of Health to inform case investigation and epidemic response. As a result, our study contributed more than 75% of the genomes from the initial phase of the local epidemic through December 2020, and overall, to over 23% of the genomes sampled in Puerto Rico published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021.\n\nOur systematic genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the local epidemic was initiated and frequently boosted by travel-associated cases. This hypothesis is supported by the diversity of B.x lineages detected in the island during a period when the local population movement was restricted by stay-at-home orders and other response measures enforced by the local government [27, 28]. In addition, the identification of multiple clusters of Puerto Rican sequences phylogenetically related to viruses found circulating primarily in the United States further supports this assessment. The increase in COVID-19 cases observed in the summer of 2020 coincided with lifting the stay-at-home order and increased traffic of tourists during a period of high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States. Travel restrictions between countries with high incidence and the United States affected Puerto Rico by interrupting international travel but potentially increasing the volumes of domestic travel to and from the island. Consequently, we did not observe frequent clustering of Puerto Rican sequences with sequences from regions other than the United States. This is further supported by the difference in lineages circulating in the Americas and Puerto Rico [42]. The frequent mixing of viruses between Puerto Rico and the United States, the lineage diversity circulating in the island, and the low density of sampling at the location of origin generated phylogenetic uncertainty, limiting the capacity to resolve the precise origin of some local clusters and specific transmission chains [43]. The evolution and lineage turnover dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the greater Caribbean region remains uncertain considering the limitations of inter-island travel, direct flights to Puerto Rico, and genomic sampling during the study period.\n\nUpon the emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first 10 months of the epidemic (March 2020-January 2021), we observed a shift in phylogenetic clustering patterns that most likely resulted from in situ viral evolution and adaptation to the local population or environment. This pattern was observed with the divergence of lineage B.1.588 from the persistent local transmission of B.1 lineage, possibly due to the founder effect. The fixation of two non-conservative mutations in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins seem to have improved fitness for local circulation. However, since this lineage was not considered a VBM, little is known about its phenotype or impact on other regions. Similar clustering patterns resembling adaptation, as well\n\nFig. 3: **Emergence of autochthonous lineage B.1.588.** Phylogenetic reconstruction of monophyletic lineage B.1.588 using Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree inferred with 239 complete genomes including 130 genomes from Puerto Rico (103 B.1.588 genomes) sampled between July 2020 and March 2021. Node support was tested by posterior probability. The gray circle represents B.1 viral genomes from Puerto Rico and the United States that cluster basal to the B.1.588 monophyletic lineage. Red circle taxa tips represent viral genomes from Puerto Rico. Colored shade bar on the right of the tree indicates the taxa region of origin. The phylogenetic tree is rooted in Wuhan/WHO/2019 and Wuhan/Hu-U/2019 reference genomes.\n\n as the divergence of local lineages, have been observed in other regions of the world after a period of sustained local transmission leading to in situ evolution, including in the United Kingdom after the re-opening of a national lockdown [44, 45, 46, 47]. Curiously, B.1.588 declined during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and increased travel in which VBM Alpha was potentially introduced. These observations indicate the limited effectiveness of the initial efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread. The subsequent decline of the first epidemic wave could potentially be attributed to the combination of the local government response measures and the launch of the vaccination campaign.\n\nThe predominance of Alpha and the subsequent second epidemic wave could suggest that this variant presented a more virulent phenotype with a higher infectivity rate that out-competted the autochthonous B.1.588 and other lineages in January 2021. This is consistent with the recurring observation that, once VBM/VOC emerged in the island, the frequency of other B.1x lineages was reduced substantially from that point forward. It is possible that this dynamic may have contributed to increased transmission during the initial phase of vaccination before the local population reached a 50% vaccination rate. Our findings are concordant with the epidemiological scenario in the United States [41, 48, 44].\n\nAs the vaccination campaign progressed during the spring of 2021, the number of cases decreased substantially, and the local government reduced most restrictions to public gatherings and indoor activities [27]. Puerto Rico then experienced another wave of increased travel during the summer of 2021 coinciding with the emergence of Delta. Though this variant was first detected in June 2021, our analyses estimated that the variant could have been introduced during the second epidemic wave in April 2021. If so, Delta could have faced a complex scenario with Alpha predominating circulation and almost half of the population vaccinated against the virus. However, the transmission of Delta displaced most of the circulating lineages and led to the third epidemic wave. Two different scenarios could be proposed for the emergence of Delta in Puerto Rico. First, Delta could have been introduced when Alpha dominated transmission, the two variants co-circulated, but Delta presented the phenotype that could outcompete Alpha. Key mutation patterns in Delta have been proposed to confer an advantage over other lineages [49]. Alternatively, the transmission of Alpha could have been already declining when Delta was introduced and emerged in a susceptible population. This second scenario proposed a gap between the dominance of Alpha and Delta. Recent reports from Madrid suggest that virus competition upon the emergence of Delta was not the exclusive factor driving the decline of Alpha but also a\n\nFig. 4: **Emergence and spread of VBM Alpha in Puerto Rico driven by multiple introductions.** Phylogenetic reconstruction using a maximum likelihood tree inferred with 730 time-calibrated complete genomes, including 160 viral genomes from Puerto Rico and 570 contextual viral genomes from the United States and the Americas to provide a regional backdrop.

Tree topology shaded in red represents clusters of viral genomes from Puerto Rico, blue shades represent clusters of genomes from the United States, and the gray shades represent clusters from other countries.\n\n period of declined Alpha transmission facilitating the emergence of Delta in the region [50]. Though it is possible to speculate that Delta's phenotype exhibited some resistance to the vaccine, the decline of the third epidemic wave after \\(\\sim\\)4 months of Delta circulation, coincides with the population reaching a 77% vaccination rate with at least one dose.\n\nThe pattern of lineage turn-over observed in this study, where the predominant variants circulated for \\(\\sim\\)4 months and then were replaced by another variant in Puerto Rico, should be further compared with the transmission in larger countries with larger populations and human movement. Similar patterns have been observed in the United States, where variant emergence and spread potentially affect Puerto Rico [51]. Travel restrictions could have blocked the introduction of additional variants directly to Puerto Rico through international travel as seen in the difference in lineages detected between Puerto Rico and the rest of the Americas and Caribbean region [42]. However, our results suggest that lineage turn-over was in part driven by domestic travel in the United States. We also speculate that these cycles could be related to the limitations of an island's geography limiting access to the island only by restricted air travel at the time, the rapid response of the local government with restrictive measures to controls the spread of the virus and a vaccination campaign that reached over 84% of the population by December 1st, 2021 [26].\n\nAlthough our study sampled viral genomes from various cases and periods during the local pandemic, the universal ARTIC v3 tiled PCR-amplicon NGS workflow's sensitivity used in this study is limited to specimens with PCR Ct values below 28. Thus, we question if there are viral genetic differences from infections with lower viral loads or inconsistent variant-calling from samples with lower viral loads that might affect the accuracy of lineage assignment [52, 53, 54]. The sampling for this study was also limited due to the ability of our partnership to procure samples from every municipality of the island, especially during the first year of the local epidemic. The availability of case metadata, such as travel history, was also limited, which would have facilitated an in-depth analysis on the impact of importations on the island. Future national genomic surveillance programs could benefit from improved systematic sampling engaging with clinical laboratories to ensure timely reporting of results to the local public health authorities, proper sample storage, and transfer to sequencing laboratories. Regarding phylogenetic analyses, the slow mutation rate and the low genetic diversity of the virus frequently impair the resolution of internal nodes with statistical support affecting the interpretation of phylogenetic histories and geographic origins. These analyses could also be affected by selecting context genomes from the unprecedented abundance of genomic data published in GISAID.\n\nThis study provides an overview of the COVID-19 epidemic in Puerto Rico during March 2020-November 2021 from the genomic epidemiology perspective. The documentation of an autochthonous lineage and dynamics of virus movement between the United States and Puerto Rico is important to inform prevention and surveillance efforts in both regions. Our phylogenetic study offers the genomic framework to understand the genomic changes occurring through time in the Puerto Rican viral population and elucidate the mutational landscape within this region. Furthermore, our ongoing genomic surveillance initiative will facilitate the study of SARS-CoV-2 intra-island phylodynamics and compare pre- and post-vaccination populations. Finally, this\n\nFig. 5: Emergence and spread of VOC Delta in Puerto Rico driven by the introduction of multiple sub-lineages.

Despite global efforts to interrupt transmission chains with quarantine, isolation, and travel restrictions at the onset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the globe, creating a global pandemic and threat to human health worldwide. By November 15th, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 253 million confirmed COVID-19 cases in 222 countries and over 5 million deaths [3, 4]. SARS-CoV-2 reached all 50 states of the United States and associated territories, including Puerto Rico, by March 2020, after multiple introductions by travelers with infection [5, 6, 7]. The rapid spread across the United States was primarily propelled by interstate transmission chains and air travel to the associated territories [8, 9, 6].\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of \\(\\sim\\)30,000 base pairs. During replication, a virus-encoded endonuclease provides a proof-reading activity that contributes to the observed low mutation rate and stable genome [10, 11]. Nevertheless, the unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally and the wealth of genomic sequence data available through the international initiative for genomic studies and surveillance has facilitated phylodynamic approaches to infer viral evolutionary rate, growth rate, and the estimated time of origin for specific outbreaks [11]. Studies have revealed that the viral genome has been accumulating mutations of concern, especially in the spike protein region, which confer phenotypes with increased fitness and pathogenicity [12, 13, 14]. Increased infectivity, resistance to monoclonal antibody therapy and evasion of the immune response were among the most frequently observed phenotypes attributed to WHO-monitored variants; these phenotypes often dominated transmission and replacement of other lineages upon emergence [15, 16, 17, 18]. The Variant Being Monitored (VBM) B.1.1.7 (Alpha) was first identified in the United States in late December 2020 and was then characterized by a considerable increase in COVID-19 incidence associated with increased infectivity and occasionally more severe disease manifestations that increased hospitalization rates [19, 20]. Alpha became the dominant variant, especially in Europe and the United States, until the emergence of Variant of Concern (VOC) B.1.617.2/AY.x (Delta), first identified in the United States in May 2021, which developed into a prominent variant with an apparent higher virulence and pathogenic phenotype [21, 22, 23]. Because of the potential for increased transmissibility, morbidity mortality, and decreased efficacy of vaccines and other intervention strategies, monitoring the spread of variants (VBMs and VOCs) rapidly became a public health concern and priority [24, 25].\n\nPuerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, is a densely populated island and a popular tourist destination located in the Caribbean basin. SARS-CoV-2 was first identified in Puerto Rico on March 13th, 2020, in two European travelers who arrived on a cruise ship and in one local resident who had close contact with family members with recent travel history. Additional travel-related and local cases were confirmed within the following weeks [26]. In response to the emerging threat, the government of Puerto Rico executed the most restrictive (compared to the United States) national stay-at-home order on March 15th, 2020, to mitigate transmission while preparing the public health infrastructure for the imminent impact [27, 28]. Travel restrictions imposed by the United States during the initial pandemic minimized international traffic to Puerto Rico, although domestic travel from the United States continued. Puerto Rico represents a unique epidemiologic setting in a geographically isolated location (an island), but with a regular influx of travelers mostly from the United States. This is an ideal setting to monitor introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants and answer questions to help inform SARS-CoV-2 spread and disease prevention strategies. Puerto Rico's public health response incorporated extensive molecular surveillance to the increased capacity, which presented a unique opportunity to study the impact of SARS-CoV-2 variant turnover, local dissemination, and evolution during a period of changing epidemiology and public health responses.\n\nIn response to the impending local epidemic, we established a partnership with the local health authorities and academia to conduct a genomic surveillance initiative to sample complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 across the island through time, monitor lineage circulation, and understand the genomic epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic in Puerto Rico. This report presents the results from 19 months of genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analyses, which identified multiple introduction events that propelled the rapid expansion and persistent transmission of the virus on the island and lead to the establishment of an autohthonous lineage between August 2020 and January 2021.\n\n## Methods\n\n### ", "Epidemiological data": "\n\nWe retrieved the number COVID-19 cases reported by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDH) from March 2020 to 30 September 2021 from the PRDH database dashboard on 1 December 2021 available here https://covid19datos.salud.gov.pr/. The collection of cases includes cases classified as confirmed (by molecular tests) or probable (by antigen tests) and plotted by date of sample collection.\n\n### ", "Patient sample selection": "\n\nNasopharyngeal swab samples pre-selected for genomic surveillance were received from COVID-19 passive surveillance conducted by PRDH, the Ponce Health Sciences University (PHSU), and hospital-based acute febrile illness surveillance conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dengue Branch. A total of 785 samples were collected from March 2020 to September 30th, 2020, from the seven health regions of the island, including 63 out of the 78 municipalities, and selection criteria included all samples with SARS-CoV-2 detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), viral load (CT \\(<\\) 28) and sufficient residual sample volume stored at \\(-80\\,\\mathrm{\\SIUnitSymbolC}\\) [29]. All samples were de-linked from patient identifiable information and processed under the guidelines approved by the CDC and Ponce School of Medicine institutional review boards (IRB) protocol 6731, which waived the need for informed consent for sequencing of residual samples.\n\n### ", "Lineage frequency analysis": "\n\nThe frequency of SARS-CoV-2 lineage detection in Puerto Rico was calculated using the total number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes published in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (https://www.gisaid.org) with collection dates ranging between March 1st, 2020 and September 30th, 2021. All complete genome sequences and metadata were retrieved from the GISAID database as of October 31st, 2021. The dataset was filtered for complete genome data, high-coverage data, and complete collection date for a final dataset of 2514 entries. Lineage assignment on GISAID was determined by the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages (Pangolin) [30, 31]. R with ggplot package was used to calculate lineage frequency and the graph focusing on the following lineages of interest: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), \\(\\mathrm{P_{1}}+\\mathrm{P_{1}}\\).1 (Gamma), B.1.588, Delta (B.1.6172.+AY.x), \\(\\mathrm{B.14.27}+\\mathrm{B.14.29}\\) (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), B.1.621/1 (Mu), and all other Pangolin-designated B lineages grouped as Other. No genomes collected in May 2020 have been published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021.\n\n\n\n**Complete genome sequencing and assembly**. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were generated directly from clinical nasopharyngeal samples. Viral RNA was extracted from viral transport media using the automated MagNA Pure 96 system (Roche) with the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral Nucleic Acid Small Volume Kit (Roche) following manufacturer-recommended protocols for 0.2 mL sample input volume and 0.1 mL RNA elution volume. MP96 external lysis buffer was used to pre-treat the samples for neutralization and assist the lysis process. First strand cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermofisher), and tiling PCR amplicons were generated using Q5* high-fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the ARTIC nCoV-2019 V3 primer scheme purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019/blob/master/primer_schema/nCoV-2019/V3/nCov-2019.tsv). Candidate samples for sequencing presented clearly visible bands of target size (-400 bp) in DNA gel electrophoresis for both primer pools. PCR products were purified with AMTure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified using Qubit 4.0 fluorometric (Thermofisher), DNA libraries were generated using the NEENext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs), reducing all reagents volumes to 25% from the manufacturer's recommended protocol to increase throughput. The resulting products were screened for size and quality using the Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies) and quantified with Qubit 4 fluorometer (ThermoFisher). Qualifying libraries were pooled and run in the MiSeq sequencer instrument (Illumina) using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 in 600-cycle program.\n\nThe resulting sequence reads were screened for quality, trimmed, and assembled into complete consensus SARS-CoV-2 genomes using the Genome Detective Virus Tool v1.136[32] (https://www.genomedetective.com) and assembly confirmed with iVar[33]. The Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used for lineage assignment[44] (https://pangolin.cog-uk.io). A total of 753 samples were sequenced with more than 95% genome coverage at a minimum of 10x sequence depth. All sequence data obtained for this study was submitted to GISAID, accession numbers available in Supplementary Data 1.\n\n**Phylogenetic analysis**. Our Puerto Rico SARS-CoV-2 genomes dataset was analyzed against a diverse panel of genomes from across the world which provide regional phylogenetic context. Initially, we downloaded the Genomic Epidemiology metadata package for all entries from GISAID on August 18th, 2021 to screen genomes for subsampling. However, due to the large number of genomes available in GISAID, we downloaded and combined the following pre-sampled datasets for regional studies: NextRegion-North America, NextRegion-South America, and NextRegion-Global. We then used the standard ncov augur/auspic multiple input workflow available in the Nextstrain platform[35] (https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov) to subsample contextual genomes and phylogenetic inference with time-stamped trees. The custom subsampling scheme program selected 2611 contextual genomes from the United States, North America, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, with higher proportions from The Americas and selected based on collection dates and genetic proximity to our Puerto Rico dataset. The combined dataset of 3364 genomes was aligned using MAFFT[36] and a global maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference was reconstructed with IQ-TREE[37]. The ncov workflow then transferred the ML tree to TreeTime[38] for time calibration and ancestral state reconstruction of the tree topology at constant rate of 8\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-4}\\) nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The resulting global ML tree was visualized with Nextstrain auspice[35] and annotated with iTol for region of origin and emerging variants[39]. Subsampling from the Genomic Epidemiology metadata package retrieved in August and from the combined NextRegions produced phylogenetic trees with similar topologies. A list of all the sequences used in this study, including sequence labels and authors can be found in the \"Data availability\" section.\n\nSelected lineages of interest were studied further by reconstruction of phylogenetic focus trees. For the B.1.588 lineages-focused tree, we selected all B.1.588 genomes published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021. Contextual B.1 lineage genomes were selected based on phylogenetic clustering near the base of the B.1.588 clade in the global tree and by temporal proximity to the date range of B.1.588 circulation between June 2020 and January 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 239 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting tree topology and node support were compared to Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree reconstruction using BEAST v1.10.4[40]. Briefly, we used time-calibrated genomes trimmed to coding sequence with sample collection dates and the nucleotide substitution model parametrized using Yang96 model under strict molecular clock, and Bayesian Skyline coalescent model. Markov chains were run for a total of 100 million steps with sampling every 10,000 steps in the chain. Run results were evaluated in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to ensure stationary parameters with statistical errors reflected in 95% highest probability density ranges with effective sample size (ESS) higher than 200 for each tree prior. MCC trees were generated in TreeAnnotator from BEAST package after discarding 10% of runs as burn-in. The resulting ML and MCC trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nFor the B.1.1.7 (Alpha VDM) lineage-focused tree, we selected all B.1.1.7 + Q.x designated genomes from the global tree and supplemented the dataset with additional B.1.1.7 + Q.x genomes from Puerto Rico and the United States to understand the lineage emergence and spread in the island. A custom subsampling scheme was selected on the Nextstrain now workflow to select genomes from samples collected between November 1st, 2020 and February 28th, 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 729 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting ML tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nFor the B.1.617.2 (Delta VOC) lineage-focused tree, we selected all B.1.617.2 + _AY.x_ designated genomes from the global tree and supplemented the dataset with additional B.1.617.2 + _AY.x_ genomes from Puerto Rico to understand lineage spread and sublineage clustering patterns across the island. The genome selector Python script designed by Anderson Brito (https://github.com/andersonbrito/ncov) was used to select additional Delta-designed genomes from Puerto Rico with collection dates range from June 1st, 2021 to September 30th, 2021. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with the resulting dataset of 815 genomes under the \\(\\mathrm{GTR}+\\mathrm{G}+1\\) nucleotide substitution model and 1000 bootstrap replicates using IQ-TREE v1.6.12[37]. The resulting ML tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree).\n\nThe date of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) determined by the Nextstrain ML phylogenetic inference was confirmed with Bayesian coalescent analyses for B.1.588, Alpha VBM and Delta VOC lineage trees. Due to the large size of the datasets, each focus tree was reduced by tree-pruning to datasets with \\(<\\)150 genomes. tMRCA analyses were performed with BEAST v1.10.4 under a strict molecular clock fixed at 8\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-4}\\) substitutions per site per year and 150 million Markov chains sampling every10,000 steps. Results were evaluated in Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) for convergence and ESS >200.\n\n**Reporting summary**. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Local epidemic and variant detection**. During March-July 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases remained low, associated with the strict stay-at-home order. After the order was lifted in June 2020, the number of cases increased steeply during the summer of 2020, initiating the local epidemic (Fig. 1a). Since then, we observed three epidemic waves with high points in November 2020, April 2021, and August 2021. By September 30th, 2021, the Puerto Rico Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 181,599 confirmed cases[26].\n\nWe conducted genomic surveillance for 19 months since March 2020, where, each month, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens from recently symptomatic and asymptomatic patients residing in 63 of the 78 municipalities, covering all seven health regions of the island. The frequency of lineages detected was calculated periodically from all viral genomic sequences from Puerto Rico published in GISAID, including our sequence datasets, and reported to the PRDH to inform case investigations and surveillance (Fig. 1b). Our data comprise the genomes from the initial SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections detected in March 2020, which included three European tourists that arrived on the island in a cruise ship and eight residents with no recent travel history declared. PANGO lineage assignment after sequencing identified lineage A.1, a lineage predominant in Europe at the time, in the three travelers with infection, while lineages B.1 and B.1.1 were identified in residents with infection. B.1x lineages predominated in the United States and the Americas. The initial phase of the epidemic was characterized by the detection of a wide diversity of B.1x lineages that circulated at low frequency for short periods of time, suggesting that the local epidemic was initiated by multiple introduction events. In August 2020, we detected the emergence of lineage B.1.588 in various municipalities of the island. Lineage B.1.588 rapidly became the predominant lineage in Puerto Rico, circulating at high frequency for \\(\\sim\\)4 months and causing the first epidemic wave in November 2020 (Fig. 1a, b). Circulation of lineage B.1.588 declined during the first wave of the epidemic in the winter of 2020, a season of local holiday festivities and frequent travel. During this season, the diversity of B.1x lineages increased, and the first emergent variants were detected in the island, VBM B.1427/429 (Epsilon) in December 2020 and Alpha in January 2021 concordant to variant emergence in the United States (Fig. 1b). Concurrently, the first stage of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Puerto Rico started in mid-December 2020 for the elderly population and first responders. A steep reduction in confirmed cases was observed in the following months despite the introduction of VBMs B.1.526 (Iota) and P.1/1.1 (Gamma) in February and March 2021 respectively and the predominant circulation of Alpha in March 2021 (Fig. 1b). The second wave of the epidemic was observed in April 2021 with Alpha predominating (Fig. 1a, b). Though other emerging variants continued to be detected, the frequency of detection remained low, and Alpha predominated for \\(\\sim\\)3-4 months. The second stage of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign started in April 2021 for all adults and was immediately followed by a sharp decrease in confirmed cases, a period in which \\(\\sim\\)50% of the population had received at least one dose of the vaccine[26] (Fig. 1a). VOC B.1.617.2/AY.x (Delta) was first detected in June 2021, concordant with the emergence in the United States, and rapidly dominated transmission. During the same period, we detected the emergence of VBM B.1.621 (Mu), which caused a small local outbreak in the western part of the island, as well as a modest increase in Gamma infections (Fig. 1b). The third epidemic wave was observed in August 2021, coinciding with a summer of increased travel and the removal of local government-imposed restrictions on business indoor occupant capacity and public gatherings (Fig. 1a, b). During this period, most COVID-19 cases in Puerto Rico were caused by Delta and \\(\\sim\\)18 Delta sub-lineages were detected in the island, with AY.3 as the most frequently sampled sub-lineage (Fig. 1c). These data provide further evidence of the multiple importations received during this period of the epidemic. By September 30th, 2021, a steep decrease in confirmed cases was observed, a point in which more than 77% of the population had received at least one dose of the vaccine (Fig. 1a).\n\n**Phylogenetic reconstruction of the local pandemic**. This study generated 753 complete genomes from viruses sampled between March 2020 and September 2021. Our dataset was combined with 2611 publicly available genomes in GISAID to understand the emergence and spread of the viruses circulating in Puerto Rico in a global context. We reconstructed the local and regional epidemic using a time-calibrated phylogenetic tree inferred with maximum likelihood (Fig. 2). This global phylogenetic analysis estimated that the initial SARS-CoV-2 introductions occurred between February 19 and March 16, 2020. Most viral genomes from Puerto Rico descend or are closely related to genomes from the United States. However, we were unable to determine the precise origin at the state level due to the limited sampling during the emergence period and subsequent low circulation. The resulting tree topology inferred viral sequences from Puerto Rico scattered across the global tree, smaller short-lived monophyletic clusters, and larger monophyletic clusters that suggest sustained transmission of a particular genotype. Our analysis also showed the emergence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 variants detected in Puerto Rico. Multiple monophyletic clusters of Puerto Rico sequences were inferred within the clades formed by each emergent variant and the size of the clades is proportional to the frequency of genomes sampled in the island (Figs. 1b and 2). The observed clustering patterns in the phylogenetic trees and the rapid increase in frequency following initial detection indicate multiple virus introductions with swift expansion across the island in a short period of time.\n\n**Detection and spread of autochthonous lineage B.1.588**. During the initial phase of epidemic transmission, we detected the emergence of an autochthonous lineage, B.1.588, which rapidly spread across the island. Based on GISAID data and co-lineages.org reports (https://cov-lineages.org/lineages), lineage B.1.588 was first detected in Puerto Rico on August 2nd, 2020: sequence EPI_ISL_1168693. Initially, lineage B.1.588 calculated only in Puerto Rico, accounting for approximately half of the viruses sampled in the island in September 2020. B.1.588 quickly became the predominant lineage in Puerto Rico during the first epidemic wave, circulating for 4 months until it was replaced by the emergence of Alpha in January 2021 (Fig. 1b). This study sequenced 97 out of the 115 B.1.588 genomes from Puerto Rico found in GISAID. To understand the emergence and spread of this lineage, we reconstructed a focused phylogenetic tree using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference with 103 B.1.588 sequences from Puerto Rico, 58 B.1.588 sequences from the United States and an additional set of 77 B.1 lineage sequences closely related to B.1.588 (Fig. 3). Our analysis estimated that lineage B.1.588 diverged from its parental lineage B.1 between May 21st, 2020, and July 16th, 2020 in Puerto Rico, after the appearance of two non-conservative mutations: T20I in the spike protein and M234I in the nucleocapsid protein. Subsequently, lineage B.1.588 spread broadly to the United States, mainly in New York, Texas, Florida, and California, where it circulated until May 2021 concomitant with a diversity of other lineages and variants. More than 990 B.1.588 genomes have been reported in the United States.\n\n**Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants.** VBM Alpha was first detected in Puerto Rico in January 2021, co-circulating with local predominant lineage B.1.588 and other B lineages at a lower rate (Fig. 1b). Notably, this VBM replaced the well-established autofluorescence-thtonous lineage B.1.588. The emergence and epidemiology of Alpha in Puerto Rico resembled the patterns observed in the United States, with rapid spread and a sharp increase in confirmed cases [19, 20, 41]. To understand the emergence and spread of Alpha in Puerto Rico, we inferred a maximum likelihood phylogenetic-focused tree with all Alpha genomes obtained in our dataset in addition to a subset of other Alpha genomes from Puerto Rico, the United States, and a regional context backdrop (Fig. 4). The resulting inference estimated that the emergence of Alpha in Puerto Rico may have occurred between November 6th, 2020, and December 31st, 2020. Tree topology showed multiple monophyletic clusters of Puerto Rican sequences diverging across a period of 4-5 months of circulation. The larger clusters of Puerto Rican sequences suggest that local transmission of specific Alpha genotypes was sustained, succeeding after multiple introduction events. Most of these clusters were associated with sequences from the United States, suggesting that multiple introductions occurred over a period of 5-6 months, propelling the local transmission of this variant. We also found a subset of Puerto Rican sequences associated with sequences from the Caribbean and the Americas but low node support impaired resolution of transmission patterns.\n\nVOC Delta was first detected in Puerto Rico in June 2021, during a period when SARS-CoV-2 transmission was declining,\n\nFig. 1: **Epidemiology and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage turn-over in Puerto Rico.** a Graphical representation of the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by antigen tests (light blue) and molecular tests (dark blue) reported by the PROH from March 2020 to September 30th, 2021, shown as a 21-day rolling average.

The phylogenetic tree is rooted in Wuhan/ WH0/2019 and Wuhan/Hu-V/2019 reference genomes.\n\n and the vaccination campaign was progressing rapidly (Fig. 1a, b). After its initial detection, Delta spread rapidly across the island (Fig. 1b). Over 30% of the COVID-19 cases sampled and sequenced in June 2021 were caused by Delta. This variant has been characterized broadly as the most dominant emerging variant, replacing most lineages, and causing most of COVID-19 cases in the United States and Puerto Rico from its emergence through November 2021. To understand the rapid emergence and spread of Delta in the island, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic-focused tree with all Delta Puerto Rican sequences obtained in our dataset supplemented with additional sequences from Puerto Rico and the United States retrieved from GISAID with collection dates between May 1st, 2021, and September 30th, 2021. According to our phylogenetic inference, the emergence of Delta in Puerto Rico may have occurred between April 15th and June 14th, 2021, potentially after one or multiple introductions. The precise origin of the introductions was challenging to resolve, considering that multiple sequences from Mexico, the United States, and the Caribbean cluster among the early sampled sequences from Puerto Rico with low node support, <75% bootstrap value (Fig. 5). The first Delta lineage to be detected was B.1.617.2, which seems directly related to a small number of VBM B.1.617.1 (Kappa) that clustered basal to the focused tree. Tree topology is similar to the patterns observed in the Alpha focus tree, where more than 17 distinct clusters with sequences from Puerto Rico were observed diverging across 4 months of circulation in the island. Most of these clusters were associated with distinct Delta sub-lineages and seem closely related to similar sequences from the United States and the Caribbean. These clustering patterns and the diversity of Delta sub-lineages detected suggest that multiple introductions throughout 5-6 months propelled the emergence and transmission of this variant in the island.\n\n## ", "Discussion": "", "Data availability": "\" section.\n\nSelected lineages of interest were studied further by reconstruction of phylogenetic focus trees. For the B.1.588 lineages-focused tree, we selected all B.1.588 genomes published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021.

We also found a subset of Puerto Rican sequences associated with sequences from the Caribbean and the Americas but low node support impaired resolution of transmission patterns.\n\nVOC Delta was first detected in Puerto Rico in June 2021, during a period when SARS-CoV-2 transmission was declining,\n\nFig. 1: **Epidemiology and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 lineage turn-over in Puerto Rico.** a Graphical representation of the number of daily SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by antigen tests (light blue) and molecular tests (dark blue) reported by the PROH from March 2020 to September 30th, 2021, shown as a 21-day rolling average.

After its initial detection, Delta spread rapidly across the island (Fig. 1b). Over 30% of the COVID-19 cases sampled and sequenced in June 2021 were caused by Delta. This variant has been characterized broadly as the most dominant emerging variant, replacing most lineages, and causing most of COVID-19 cases in the United States and Puerto Rico from its emergence through November 2021. To understand the rapid emergence and spread of Delta in the island, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic-focused tree with all Delta Puerto Rican sequences obtained in our dataset supplemented with additional sequences from Puerto Rico and the United States retrieved from GISAID with collection dates between May 1st, 2021, and September 30th, 2021. According to our phylogenetic inference, the emergence of Delta in Puerto Rico may have occurred between April 15th and June 14th, 2021, potentially after one or multiple introductions. The precise origin of the introductions was challenging to resolve, considering that multiple sequences from Mexico, the United States, and the Caribbean cluster among the early sampled sequences from Puerto Rico with low node support, <75% bootstrap value (Fig. 5). The first Delta lineage to be detected was B.1.617.2, which seems directly related to a small number of VBM B.1.617.1 (Kappa) that clustered basal to the focused tree. Tree topology is similar to the patterns observed in the Alpha focus tree, where more than 17 distinct clusters with sequences from Puerto Rico were observed diverging across 4 months of circulation in the island. Most of these clusters were associated with distinct Delta sub-lineages and seem closely related to similar sequences from the United States and the Caribbean. These clustering patterns and the diversity of Delta sub-lineages detected suggest that multiple introductions throughout 5-6 months propelled the emergence and transmission of this variant in the island.\n\n## Discussion\n\nDespite initial containment of COVID-19 cases in the spring of 2020, SARS-CoV-2 subsequently spread rapidly across the island propelled by multiple introductions and extensive intra-island transmission. Our partnership responded rapidly with the launch of this collaborative study aimed at enhancing the local capacity for genomic surveillance, understanding the development of the epidemic, and tracking viral lineages of public health concern. Our efforts also led to the early identification and tracking of most of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of lineages circulating in the island; information that was reported monthly to the Puerto Rico Department of Health to inform case investigation and epidemic response. As a result, our study contributed more than 75% of the genomes from the initial phase of the local epidemic through December 2020, and overall, to over 23% of the genomes sampled in Puerto Rico published in GISAID by October 31st, 2021.\n\nOur systematic genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the local epidemic was initiated and frequently boosted by travel-associated cases. This hypothesis is supported by the diversity of B.x lineages detected in the island during a period when the local population movement was restricted by stay-at-home orders and other response measures enforced by the local government [27, 28]. In addition, the identification of multiple clusters of Puerto Rican sequences phylogenetically related to viruses found circulating primarily in the United States further supports this assessment. The increase in COVID-19 cases observed in the summer of 2020 coincided with lifting the stay-at-home order and increased traffic of tourists during a period of high SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United States. Travel restrictions between countries with high incidence and the United States affected Puerto Rico by interrupting international travel but potentially increasing the volumes of domestic travel to and from the island. Consequently, we did not observe frequent clustering of Puerto Rican sequences with sequences from regions other than the United States. This is further supported by the difference in lineages circulating in the Americas and Puerto Rico [42]. The frequent mixing of viruses between Puerto Rico and the United States, the lineage diversity circulating in the island, and the low density of sampling at the location of origin generated phylogenetic uncertainty, limiting the capacity to resolve the precise origin of some local clusters and specific transmission chains [43]. The evolution and lineage turnover dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the greater Caribbean region remains uncertain considering the limitations of inter-island travel, direct flights to Puerto Rico, and genomic sampling during the study period.\n\nUpon the emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the first 10 months of the epidemic (March 2020-January 2021), we observed a shift in phylogenetic clustering patterns that most likely resulted from in situ viral evolution and adaptation to the local population or environment. This pattern was observed with the divergence of lineage B.1.588 from the persistent local transmission of B.1 lineage, possibly due to the founder effect. The fixation of two non-conservative mutations in the spike and nucleocapsid proteins seem to have improved fitness for local circulation. However, since this lineage was not considered a VBM, little is known about its phenotype or impact on other regions. Similar clustering patterns resembling adaptation, as well\n\nFig. 3: **Emergence of autochthonous lineage B.1.588.** Phylogenetic reconstruction of monophyletic lineage B.1.588 using Bayesian maximum clade credibility tree inferred with 239 complete genomes including 130 genomes from Puerto Rico (103 B.1.588 genomes) sampled between July 2020 and March 2021. Node support was tested by posterior probability. The gray circle represents B.1 viral genomes from Puerto Rico and the United States that cluster basal to the B.1.588 monophyletic lineage. Red circle taxa tips represent viral genomes from Puerto Rico. Colored shade bar on the right of the tree indicates the taxa region of origin. The phylogenetic tree is rooted in Wuhan/WHO/2019 and Wuhan/Hu-U/2019 reference genomes.\n\n as the divergence of local lineages, have been observed in other regions of the world after a period of sustained local transmission leading to in situ evolution, including in the United Kingdom after the re-opening of a national lockdown [44, 45, 46, 47]. Curiously, B.1.588 declined during a period of high transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and increased travel in which VBM Alpha was potentially introduced. These observations indicate the limited effectiveness of the initial efforts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 introductions and spread. The subsequent decline of the first epidemic wave could potentially be attributed to the combination of the local government response measures and the launch of the vaccination campaign.\n\nThe predominance of Alpha and the subsequent second epidemic wave could suggest that this variant presented a more virulent phenotype with a higher infectivity rate that out-competted the autochthonous B.1.588 and other lineages in January 2021. This is consistent with the recurring observation that, once VBM/VOC emerged in the island, the frequency of other B.1x lineages was reduced substantially from that point forward. It is possible that this dynamic may have contributed to increased transmission during the initial phase of vaccination before the local population reached a 50% vaccination rate. Our findings are concordant with the epidemiological scenario in the United States [41, 48, 44].\n\nAs the vaccination campaign progressed during the spring of 2021, the number of cases decreased substantially, and the local government reduced most restrictions to public gatherings and indoor activities [27]. Puerto Rico then experienced another wave of increased travel during the summer of 2021 coinciding with the emergence of Delta. Though this variant was first detected in June 2021, our analyses estimated that the variant could have been introduced during the second epidemic wave in April 2021. If so, Delta could have faced a complex scenario with Alpha predominating circulation and almost half of the population vaccinated against the virus. However, the transmission of Delta displaced most of the circulating lineages and led to the third epidemic wave. Two different scenarios could be proposed for the emergence of Delta in Puerto Rico. First, Delta could have been introduced when Alpha dominated transmission, the two variants co-circulated, but Delta presented the phenotype that could outcompete Alpha. Key mutation patterns in Delta have been proposed to confer an advantage over other lineages [49]. Alternatively, the transmission of Alpha could have been already declining when Delta was introduced and emerged in a susceptible population. This second scenario proposed a gap between the dominance of Alpha and Delta. Recent reports from Madrid suggest that virus competition upon the emergence of Delta was not the exclusive factor driving the decline of Alpha but also a\n\nFig. 4: **Emergence and spread of VBM Alpha in Puerto Rico driven by multiple introductions.** Phylogenetic reconstruction using a maximum likelihood tree inferred with 730 time-calibrated complete genomes, including 160 viral genomes from Puerto Rico and 570 contextual viral genomes from the United States and the Americas to provide a regional backdrop.

Though it is possible to speculate that Delta's phenotype exhibited some resistance to the vaccine, the decline of the third epidemic wave after \\(\\sim\\)4 months of Delta circulation, coincides with the population reaching a 77% vaccination rate with at least one dose.\n\nThe pattern of lineage turn-over observed in this study, where the predominant variants circulated for \\(\\sim\\)4 months and then were replaced by another variant in Puerto Rico, should be further compared with the transmission in larger countries with larger populations and human movement. Similar patterns have been observed in the United States, where variant emergence and spread potentially affect Puerto Rico [51]. Travel restrictions could have blocked the introduction of additional variants directly to Puerto Rico through international travel as seen in the difference in lineages detected between Puerto Rico and the rest of the Americas and Caribbean region [42]. However, our results suggest that lineage turn-over was in part driven by domestic travel in the United States. We also speculate that these cycles could be related to the limitations of an island's geography limiting access to the island only by restricted air travel at the time, the rapid response of the local government with restrictive measures to controls the spread of the virus and a vaccination campaign that reached over 84% of the population by December 1st, 2021 [26].\n\nAlthough our study sampled viral genomes from various cases and periods during the local pandemic, the universal ARTIC v3 tiled PCR-amplicon NGS workflow's sensitivity used in this study is limited to specimens with PCR Ct values below 28. Thus, we question if there are viral genetic differences from infections with lower viral loads or inconsistent variant-calling from samples with lower viral loads that might affect the accuracy of lineage assignment [52, 53, 54]. The sampling for this study was also limited due to the ability of our partnership to procure samples from every municipality of the island, especially during the first year of the local epidemic. The availability of case metadata, such as travel history, was also limited, which would have facilitated an in-depth analysis on the impact of importations on the island. Future national genomic surveillance programs could benefit from improved systematic sampling engaging with clinical laboratories to ensure timely reporting of results to the local public health authorities, proper sample storage, and transfer to sequencing laboratories. Regarding phylogenetic analyses, the slow mutation rate and the low genetic diversity of the virus frequently impair the resolution of internal nodes with statistical support affecting the interpretation of phylogenetic histories and geographic origins. These analyses could also be affected by selecting context genomes from the unprecedented abundance of genomic data published in GISAID.\n\nThis study provides an overview of the COVID-19 epidemic in Puerto Rico during March 2020-November 2021 from the genomic epidemiology perspective. The documentation of an autochthonous lineage and dynamics of virus movement between the United States and Puerto Rico is important to inform prevention and surveillance efforts in both regions. Our phylogenetic study offers the genomic framework to understand the genomic changes occurring through time in the Puerto Rican viral population and elucidate the mutational landscape within this region. Furthermore, our ongoing genomic surveillance initiative will facilitate the study of SARS-CoV-2 intra-island phylodynamics and compare pre- and post-vaccination populations. Finally, this\n\nFig. 5: Emergence and spread of VOC Delta in Puerto Rico driven by the introduction of multiple sub-lineages.

The goal was to assess how likely Austrian ICUs would become overburdened with COVID-19 patients in the upcoming weeks.\n\n**Methods** We consolidated the output of three epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds.\n\n**Results** We report on three key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austria's policy to navigate the crisis, namely (i) when and where case numbers and bed occupancy are expected to peak during multiple waves, (ii) whether to ease or strengthen non-pharmaceutical intervention in response to changing incidences, and (iii) how to provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities.\n\n**Conclusions** Complex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, in particular when they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points.\n\n[1]Institute of Information Systems Engineering, TU Wien, Favoritenstrasse

In the first half of March 2020, a nationwide spread of the virus occurred with an exponential rise of confirmed cases [2]. These developments occurred against the dramatic backdrop of the neighbouring country of Italy, where despite strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) case numbers kept surging, hospital capacities were exceeded and the military had to assist the health authorities [3, 4]. To understand how likely similar developments would have been in Austria, mid-March a forecast consortium was formed and tasked by the government with a weekly forecasting of the expected developments in case numbers and how these developments would translate into demand for healthcare resources. The overarching policy goal at this stage was to navigate the crisis without overburdening the Austrian healthcare system. Over the summer, this was also given a legal basis with a clause in the Austrian COVID law that stay-at-home orders may only be implemented if healthcare capacities are in danger of becoming exhausted [5]. The Austrian Corona Commission, an advisory committee to the minister of health tasked with assessment of epidemiological risk, defined that ICUs would be able to cope with situations in which up to 33% of all ICU beds would be occupied by COVID-19 patients [6].\n\nAustria took a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in response to the crisis [7] during the first wave. Next to a ramping up of healthcare and public health capacities, airport restrictions and landing bans intensified in the first week of March. Gatherings were limited to 500 persons, cultural and other events started to be cancelled on March 10. On March 16, Austria went into a full lockdown with schools, bars, restaurants, and shops being closed, as well as a transitioning into home office for all non-essential employees [8]. Together with other, earlier measures, these NPIs effectively led to a rapid reduction of daily infection numbers. The number of new cases per day reached a first peak on March 26 with 1,065 cases [8]. In the first wave, COVID-19 related hospitalizations peaked on March 31 with 912 regular beds, whereas the ICU utilization peaked on April 8 with 267 beds (roughly 10% of the overall capacity) being occupied by COVID-19 patients. Daily new cases decreased over April after which they fluctuated at values below one hundred until July [9].\n\nStarting in July 2020, case numbers in Austria started to increase again leading to a second wave in October. In response to this rise of case numbers, the Austrian government implemented a series of lockdowns with varying levels of stringency since beginning of November 2020. Hospitalizations peaked in the end of November, with 3,985 regular beds occupied on November 24, and 709 ICU beds occupied on November 25, respectively. According to officially reported data, this peak brought Austrian hospitals very close to the critical limit of 33% ICU bed occupancy by COVID patients.\n\nThe Austrian COVID-19 forecast consortium provided weekly short-term forecasts for case numbers and required hospital beds. In particular, the role of the forecast consortium was to forecast how likely the 33% threshold of ICU beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients would be crossed within our forecast horizon. Our consortium consisted of three independent modelling teams with experience in the use and development of mathematical and computational models to address epidemiological and public health challenges [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The consortium was complemented with experts from the Ministry of Health, the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety, as well as external public health experts in weekly meetings.\n\nA plethora of epidemiological models to forecast the spread of COVID-19 has been proposed recently [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In the forecast consortium, we consolidated the output of three models into a single forecast of case numbers for 8-14 days and used these case numbers to predict the numbers of required hospital and ICU beds for 21 days for the country as a whole and for each of its nine federal states. In addition to these point estimates, we also provided upper and lower bounds for these numbers at various levels of confidence. These upper bounds of the hospital bed forecasts served as a guidance system for the regional hospital managers, allowing them to estimate how many beds should be reserved for COVID-19 patients if they were willing to accept a given level of risk. These forecasts have been published each week on the homepage of the Ministry of Health [23].\n\nThe idea of using a harmonized epidemiological forecast became popular for influenza prognoses [24] and was recently also adapted for COVID-19 forecasts by the European Center for Disease Control [25]. For influenza, the strategy has already been shown to be superior to results of individual models with respect to forecasting errors. Moreover, since the results are highly relevant for policy-making, this strategy also allowed for risk-sharing between the involved institutions making up the consortium.\n\nWhile the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered an explosive growth of epidemiological forecasting models, substantially less research has been performed regarding how the results of such models should be disseminated for decision support [26, 27, 28]. In this work, therefore, we present the forecast and reporting system we developed based on the three independent forecasting models to support policy making in Austria. While the individual models have been adapted from pre-existing works, our main novelty lies in developing a reporting system to communicate relevant output to non-technical experts and to inform decisions regarding strengthening or easing NPIs.\n\nAfter a brief summary of the individual models and strategies to combine their output, we describe the accuracy of our forecasts and how this accuracy depended on the phase of the epidemics (i.e., in high or low incidence phases, during waves, etc.). We consistently find that the combined forecasts were more accurate than any of the individual forecasts for three different strategies of combining them. Substantial over- or underestimations of the actual development typically occurred in all models simultaneously and sometimes signalled epidemiological change points. We discuss how our results were received by policy-makers, stakeholders in the healthcare system, and the public. We outline the main contributions of our approach to chart a safe path to re-open the country after the first lockdown and how the system informed the necessity for a second lockdown in November 2020. The aim of this work is to communicate the methods applied and developed which allowed three individually thinking modelling and simulation research units to work together in a joint task force producing a consolidated forecast, the benefits and shortcomings of the process, and the political impact of the achieved results. We conclude that epidemiological models can be useful as the basis for short-term forecast-based monitoring systems to detect epidemiological change points which in turn inform on the necessity to strengthen or ease NPIs.\n\n## Methods\n\nWe used three conceptually different epidemiological COVID-19 models, developed and operated individually by three research institutions, namely a modified SIR-X differential equation model (Medical University of Vienna / Complexity Science Hub), an Agent-Based simulation model (TU Wien/dwh GmbH), and an epidemiological state space model (Austrian National Public Health Institute).\n\n* **Data.** Although the three models use different parameters and parametrization routines, they are calibrated using the same datato generate weekly forecasts. Consequently, differences between the model forecasts are a result of different model structure and calibration, but not a result of different data sources. The models also used different nowcasting approaches to correct for late reporting of positive test results. We used data from the official Austrian COVID-19 disease reporting system (EMS[9]). The system is operated by the Austrian Ministry of Health, the federal administrations, and the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety.\n\nFor every person tested positively in Austria, the EMS contains information on the date of the test, date of recovery or death, age, sex and place of residence. Furthermore, hospital occupancy of COVID-19 patients in ICU and normal wards are available from daily reports collected by the Ministry for Internal Affairs.\n\nWe declare that our research does not require ethics approval. We used an existing secondary dataset maintained as database to collect the information needed. It includes anonymous information and it is not possible to link data in order to generate identifiable information. Data are properly anonymised. The information is legally accessible and appropriately protected by law.\n\n**Extended SIR-X model.** One of our models is an extension of the recently introduced SIR-X model[17]. The original SIR-X model introduced a parsimonious way to extend the classic SIR dynamics with the impact of NPIs. In particular, two classes of NPIs are considered. First, there are NPIs that lead to a contact reduction of all individuals (susceptible and infected ones). Such NPIs include social distancing and other lockdown measures. Second, the model also represents NPIs that reduce the effective duration of infectiousness for infected individuals. Contactracting and quarantine belong to this category.\n\nThe model was extended by adding mechanisms by which susceptible but quarantined individuals increase their number of contacts again as well as waning immunity; we refer to this model as the XSIR-X model. The model further includes an age-structured population. Model parameters are calibrated using a numerical optimization procedure that is separately performed in multiple time windows corresponding to phases with different regimes of NPIs. Whether changes in NPIs indeed led to substantial changes in behaviour was inferred from mobility data to identify such calibration time windows[29, 30]. A more detailed technical model description can be found in Supplementary Note 2.\n\n**Agent-based SEIR model**. The second model is an Agent-Based SEIR type model, furthermore abbreviated as AB model. In this section we will only give a rough overview of this model. For a detailed and technical model description (about 20 pages long) including all used parameter values we refer to previous published work (see supplemental material in [13]). Since the model is subject to continuous improvements, the model description is continuously updated and found at http://www.dwh.at/en/projects/covid-19/.\n\nThe AB model is stochastic, population-dynamic and depicts every inhabitant of Austria as one model agent. It uses sampling methods to generate an initial agent population with statistically representative demographic properties and makes use of a partially event-based, partially time-step (1 day)-based update strategy to enhance in time.\n\nThe model is based on a validated population model of Austria including demographic processes like death, birth, and migration[15]. Contacts between agents are responsible for disease transmission and are sampled via locations in which agents meet: schools, workplaces, households and leisure-time. After being infected, agents go through a detailed disease and/or patient pathway that depicts the different states of the disease and the treatment of the patient.\n\nThe model input consists of a time-line of modelled NPIs; parameters are calibrated using a modified bisection method. For generation of the weekly forecasts, the model is fitted to the 7 day incidence of the new confirmed cases of the last 21 days including a nowcasting correction for the last week to supplement for subsequent registrations.\n\nResults are gathered via Monte-Carlo simulations as the point-wise sample mean of multiple simulation runs. Due to the large number of agents in the model, eight simulation runs are used which are sufficient to have the sample mean approximate the real unknown mean with an error of less than 1% with 95% confidence (estimated by the Gaussian stopping as introduced in ref. [31]).\n\nThe model considers uncertainty with respect to the stochastic perturbations in the model by tracing the standard deviation of the Monte-Carlo simulations. Parameter uncertainty is considered in form of manually defined best and worst case scenarios.\n\n**Epidemiological state space model**. The third model isolates weekday effects, statistical outliers and exogenous shocks in order accurately identify and extrapolate the current trend in reported new infections.\n\nWe therefore use a multivariate autoregressive state space model, where reported numbers of daily new infections (including corrections for exogenous shocks and nowcasting for the recent days) are explained by underlying latent factors (\"states\") and exogenous variables.\n\nThe basic structure of the model follows a random walk of order 2 and includes weekday effects that may change over time. Further information can be incorporated into the model by defining exogenous variables. The coefficients of these effects are not determined in the model but extracted from external sources. Currently, exogenous data included in the model comprise the effective immunization rate of the population, seasonal effects, number of imported cases, and NPI.\n\nEffective immunization rates are calculated as the share of immunized individuals (vaccinated and/or recovered) times the corresponding empirically estimated effectiveness of protection against reported infections based on the screening method[32]. Seasonal forcing is modelled by the cosine function, with a maximum positive impact on transmission rates in January. The magnitude of seasonal effects are based on literature estimates[33]. The number of imported cases is based on Austrian contact-tracing data[34]. NPIs are incorporated based on information on NPIs in place at federal and regional level[15] and their reported effects on transmission rates[36].\n\nFor a more technical model description refer to Supplementary Note 2.\n\n**Model harmonization**. In order to harmonize the model output and generate a single consolidated forecast for the number of new and accumulated positive COVID-19 tests, each model was set up to generate its output in a common data format for each of the nine federal states of Austria. Our forecasts consisted of time series of confirmed cases for each day starting with the number of positive tests at the day of the forecast consortium meeting at 11:59 pm and ending between 8 and 14 days in the future (over time, we slightly increased the forecast horizon).\n\nDifferent averaging procedures were considered to generate the joined forecast from the three individual forecasts. These included the point-wise arithmetic and geometric mean as well as an adaptive weighting procedure wherein the timeseries for each model contributes with weights proportional to the accuracy of its most recent forecasts. This strategy was adapted from previous work [24, 37]. The following three strategies have been evaluated in terms of their forecast error. Let \\(F_{i}^{i}(t)\\) denote the forecasts for the total number of COVID-19 cases on day \\(t\\) for model \\(j\\) for runs made in week \\(i\\),\n\n\\[F_{i}^{h}(t)=f(F_{i}^{h}(t),F_{i}^{h}(t),F_{i}^{h}(t))\\] (1)\n\nthe harmonized forecast with strategy \\(f_{i}\\) and \\(R_{i}\\) the corresponding reported number.\n\n* **Naive**. This strategy describes a static arithmetic average \\[f(F_{i}^{1}(t),F_{i}^{2}(t),F_{i}^{3}(t)):=\\frac{1}{3}F_{i}^{1}(t)+\\frac{1}{3} F_{i}^{2}(t)+\\frac{1}{3}F_{i}^{3}(t)\\] (2)\n* **Geometric**. This strategy describes the static geometric average of the forecasts. \\[f(F_{i}^{1}(t),F_{i}^{2}(t),F_{i}^{3}(t)):=\\sqrt{F_{i}^{1}(t)F_{i}^{2}(t)F_{i} ^{3}(t)}\\] (3)\n* **Continuously weighted dynamic mean**. This strategy describes a dynamically weighted arithmetic average. \\[f(x,y,z):=a_{i}^{1}F_{i}^{1}(t)+a_{i}^{2}F_{i}^{2}(t)+a_{i}^{3}F_{i}^{3}(t)\\] (4) The weights are determined from the forecasting errors of the previous three weeks. \\[a_{i}^{j}=\\frac{1}{3}\\sum\\limits_{k=(i-3)}^{i-1}w_{k}^{j},\\quad w_{k}^{j}= \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\max(|y\\bar{F}-R_{k}|,0.5)}{\\max(|\\bar{F}-R_{k}|,0.5)}}\\,,j\\in \\{1,2,3\\}.\\] (5)\n\nHospital bed usage model.Hospital occupancy is modelled in a stock-flow approach, in which the \"stock\" of hospital patients is changed over time by means of an in- and outflow of patients. Inflow (admission to ICU and normal wards) is calculated as a ratio of the time-delayed number of recently reported and projected new cases from the harmonized model forecast. Length of stay determines outflow. Admission rates are scaled in order to fit the current occupancy in all federal states. The scaling parameter (one for each federal state) can thus be interpreted as an effective hospitalization rate. Model parameters were initially extracted from literature [38] and subsequently calibrated to observational data to better fit the observed time series; see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. Length of stay is modelled based on the empirical distribution of length of stay with a cut-off value of maximum 100 days. The hospital bed usage model is stratified by four age groups and sex as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Mean average length of stay for admissions in the period January to May 2021 (and discharges in the period January to June 2021) was 13.4 for ICU stays and 10.7 for normal ward stays.\n\nConfidence intervals for forecasts.Confidence intervals (CIs) for both case numbers of the harmonized model and hospital occupancy are derived from the empirical forecast error of each prognosis day. More specific, we retrospectively evaluate the ratio of the consolidated forecast and the observed seven-day-incidence rate of confirmed cases for each day over the forecast interval. The upper and lower limits of the 68% and 95% CIs used for the reporting of our forecasts are derived from the corresponding percentiles of the empirical distribution of the observed forecast error.\n\nIt is assumed that forecasting errors can be reasonably approximated by a log-normal distribution that is independent of the starting level of case numbers, that the variance increases with the forecast horizon, and that the forecast error of the first and second day of the forecast is skewed because increases due to delayed reporting are more likely than decreases in case numbers due to backdating. We therefore consider the relative logarithmic forecast error tuples \\(\\tilde{x}_{i,h}\\) where \\(i\\) denotes the number of the prognosis, and \\(h\\) denotes the forecast horizon. These tuples are evaluated in a 2-dimensional kernel-density estimation (KDE). The resulting density function is evaluated at slices of \\(h=1,2,\\ldots,H\\), where \\(H\\) is the last day of the forecast. 0.025, 0.16, 0.84 and 0.975 percentiles give thresholds for the error bands in the case number projections for \\(h\\).\n\nFor the confidence intervals of the ICU and hospital occupancy we additionally take the occupancy on the first prognosis day into account because the fluctuations of the occupancy numbers played a much higher role for the error than the parameter uncertainty. Specifically, an almost linear relation between the level of uncertainty and the square root of the occupancy on the first prognosis day could be observed.\n\nWe regard the tuples \\(Y_{i,j}=(\\Delta_{i,j},\\sqrt{X_{i}})\\). Hereby, \\(\\Delta_{i,j}\\) denotes the logarithmic error \\(\\log(X_{i,j}/\\tilde{X}_{i,j})\\) between the reported occupancy \\(X_{i,j}\\) and the forecast occupancy \\(\\tilde{X}_{i,j}\\) of day \\(j\\) in prognosis week \\(i\\). Furthermore \\(X_{i,j}=X_{i,h}=\\tilde{X}_{i,0}\\) denotes the occupancy on the day of the prognosis in week \\(i\\). The tuples \\(Y_{i,j}\\) are evaluated in a 2-dimensional kernel-density estimation (KDE) using Scott's Rule to obtain the kernel function \\(f(\\Delta,\\sqrt{X})\\).\n\nTo generate CIs, the marginal distributions\n\n\\[f_{\\sqrt{X}}(\\Delta)=\\frac{f(\\Delta,\\sqrt{X})}{\\int_{\\Delta}\\!f(u,\\sqrt{X})du}\\]\n\nare calculated numerically. Finally, the percentiles of \\(f_{\\sqrt{X}}(\\Delta)\\) give the CIs for the logarithmic error, given a certain occupancy \\(X\\) on the day of the prognosis.\n\nForecasting error evaluation.Forecasts are evaluated at the weekly official meetings of the consortium. A list of all dates (as well as officially reported forecasts) can be found online [23]. To quantify the error of the case forecasts, the total number of reported and projected new cases since the last meeting are compared using data as reported on the day of the meeting. For example, the forecast harmonized on April 3, 2020 was evaluated on the meeting on April 10th by comparing the total number of new cases reported between April 3rd and April 9th with the projected ones.\n\nTo avoid bias, relative and not absolute differences and errors are taken into account.\n\nReporting summary.Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### Forecasting positive test numbers\n\nWe show the results for our rolling forecasts compared with the actual case numbers in Fig. 1 for 72 forecasts. For the time period from April 4 to Summer 2021, we performed and harmonized weekly forecasts that are visibly as bundles of lines in Fig. 1. The first published forecasts coincided closely with the peak of the first epidemic wave in Austria. While the models showed a clearly discernible divergence for the first forecast, the agreement increased over the first wave. The starting points for the early weekly forecasts occasionally lie below the actual cases due to a substantial amount of very late reporting of cases in these early periods of the epidemic. From May until July, reported cases remained at a comparably low level.\n\n Starting from late August to early September, the onset of the second wave is visible. A critical point was the prognosis for the week until October 25, highlighted in yellow in Fig. 1. There, the consolidated forecast clearly underestimated the actual rise in confirmed cases. The forecasts made in the weeks thereafter were more accurate, however, the CI strongly increased due to the less accurate forecasts from the first half of October. A gradual flattening of the curve until end of January can be observed after the steep increase in November, during which the forecasts had a tendency to overestimate the degree of the flattening.\n\nThe early increase of the third wave in March 2021 was anticipated by the models due to the alpha variant becoming dominant. However, the peak of the third wave was not anticipated, as were the substantial decreases in reported cases in the following weeks when possibly seasonal factors increasingly curbed the virus spread.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we compare the model-specific forecast error with the forecast error of the consolidated model, the incidence and the effective reproduction number in Austria. In April 2020, agreement amongst the three models is typically stronger than the agreement with the data, meaning if one model over- or underestimated the actual trend, so did the other models. After the summer, agreement between the three models was larger than in the early phases of the pandemic. Comparing the upper and lower part of this image also shows that none of the models anticipated a spontaneous rise in \\(R_{\\text{eff}}\\) in combination with a large number of daily cases in August/September and October. This was particularly well visible at end of October (see the dotted lines in Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the violin representation in Fig. 3, which shows the relative differences between forecasts and reported data of all forecasts ever made, indicates that no persistent systematic over- or underestimation occurs while it cannot be ruled out that such systematic aberrations might have occurred over smaller periods of time.\n\nWe investigated the performance of different averaging procedures that weigh models according to their past performance in terms of their relative difference and error, see Methods. The results are summarized in Table 1. Performance weighting procedures yielded only a marginal improvement over simple averaging in terms of forecast accuracy. This further corroborates that agreement amongst the model forecasts is typically higher than their agreement with the observed case numbers.\n\n \n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l} \\hline \\hline Week 22, 2020-09-08 to 2020-09-17 (strong underestimate due to decline of seasonal effects) & \\\\ Strategy & Formula for mean (SR-X (o), AB & Relative error \\\\  & (y), 55 (2)) & \\\\ Naive & \\(0.33\\%+0.33y+0.33z\\) & 30.44y \\\\ Geometric & \\(\\sqrt{y_{0}^{2}}\\) & 30.55\\% \\\\ Continuous & \\(0.36\\%+0.32y+0.32z\\) & 30.7\\% \\\\ Week 51, 2021-03-03-00 10 2021-04-06 (overestimated seasonality-caused \\\\ turning point in spring) & \\\\ Naive & \\(0.33\\%+0.33y+0.33z\\) & 14.3\\% \\\\ Geometric & \\(\\sqrt{y_{0}^{2}}\\) & 14.3\\% \\\\ Continuous & \\(0.36\\%+0.37y+0.28z\\) & 14.4\\% \\\\ Week 45, 2021-02-01 to 2021-02-09 (well predicted turnaround of case \\\\ numbers after lockdown & \\\\ Naive & \\(0.33\\%+0.33y+0.33z\\) & 6.6\\% \\\\ Geometric & \\(\\sqrt{y_{0}^{2}}\\) & 6.6\\% \\\\ Continuous & \\(0.20\\%+0.36y+0.44z\\) & 7.3\\% \\\\ Week 40. 2021-01-12 to 2021-01-19 (very well predicted decline under constant measures) & \\\\ Naive & \\(0.33\\%+0.33y+0.33z\\) & 1.2\\% \\\\ Geometric & \\(\\sqrt{y_{0}^{2}}\\) & 1.8\\% \\\\ Continuous & \\(0.76\\%+0.08y+0.16z\\) & 0.6\\% \\\\ Weeks 2-86 & Strategy & Median relative error & \\\\ Naive & \\(5.21\\%\\) & 9.70\\% \\\\ Geometric & \\(5.23\\%\\) & 10.02\\% \\\\ Continuous & \\(4.98\\%\\) & 10.06\\% \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} We consider a wide arithmetic mean (\u201cfrequency\u201d), geometric mean (\u201cgeometric\u201d) as well as an adaptive method (\u201ccontinuous\u201d) which weights the models according to their recent performance.

Since the mean relative differences are close to zero, no persistent systematic over or underestimation of the cases occurs.

The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 3.\n\nFig. 2: **Evaluation of the forecast performance.** Daily new confirmed cases and estimated \\(R_{\\text{eff}}\\)\\({}^{9}\\) (top panel) and forecasting performance (relative difference, bottom panel) of the individual models and the harmonized mean are shown for 72 forecasts.

The red dashed line gives the threshold of 33% of all ICU beds being in use for COVID-19 patients. We highlight again (yellow in Fig. 4) the forecast for the week until October 25, in which we severely underestimated the developments. After adjusting the models for these developments, the next forecast projected that the 33% threshold would likely be crossed in two to three weeks. After the second peak passed, the model showed a tendency to overestimate the pace at which patients would be released from ICU. Forecast accuracy during the third wave was overall much higher for the ICU forecast compared to the forecasts of the case numbers.\n\n**Reporting of the forecasts.** We developed a standard reporting template to communicate our forecasts to other stakeholders and decision-makers, see Fig. 5. These visual reports showed our forecasts for cases and hospital occupancy, as well as information on the effective reproduction number. The visual reports are complemented by a brief synopsis of the researcher's appraisal of the current situation and particularities of the most recent forecast. These appraisals are publicly accessible [23]. Furthermore, the researchers are at disposal for any questions that members of the health ministers' office or the regional crisis management units may have.\n\nThe first panel in Fig. 5 provides an outlook for the expected developments in weekly cases (per 100,000 population). Due to known weekday effects, we do not give forecasts for daily case numbers. Expected hospital occupancy is given in the second panel. All forecasts are supplemented with 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The forecasts are also presented in the weekly sessions of the Austrian Corona Commission, an advisory body to the minister of health tasked with assessing the epidemiological risk in Austria. The expected occupancy rates of ICU is an indicator in assessing the risk of health system overburdening and thus directly contributes to the classification of Austrian regions according to this risk, which in turn informs recommendations on easing or strengthening control measures[6].\n\n## Discussion\n\nConsidering the impact of COVID-19 policy measures on economic and social life, any related decision support needs to be done with caution. Our approach considers the high impact of COVID-19 forecasts by (1) focusing on monitoring rather than long-term prognosis and (2) consolidation of three different \"model opinions\" which not only improved the quality of the short-term forecast, but also distributed the responsibility of the decision support on multiple teams.\n\nFrom the very beginning of our work as consortium, we decided to publish only short-term forecasts and to refrain from\n\nFig. 4: Forecasting bed usage. Rolling combined and consolidated out-of-sample forecasts for the number of intensive care beds currently in use for COVID-19 patients including corresponding CI, the actual numbers of beds occupied, and 33% of total ICU capacity as a reference. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 4.\n\n publishing longer-term scenarios. Due to the multiplicative growth of uncertainties in epidemiological models, accurate forecasts are typically only possible over a time horizon of several days [39, 40, 41, 42]. There is no meaningful way to estimate the uncertainty for long-term scenarios that span over several weeks, months or even years. For policy-makers and non-technical experts, the distinction between a prognosis with a defined level of certainty and a hypothetical what-if experiment is hard to communicate.\n\nOur forecasts provided evidence for the expected total number of daily infections and hospitalized cases including appraisals of uncertainty via forecast intervals. This is in contrast to what has been popularly described as \"worst case coronavirus science\", i.e. the communication of worst case scenarios as baselines in the public pandemic management strategy [43]. For instance, the UK policy change toward adopting more drastic NPIs on March 23 was based on worst case scenarios created by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team that within the current policy regime 250,000 deaths were to be expected. In a press conference in April, the Austrian chancellor publicly stated that soon \"everyone will know someone who died because of COVID-19\", based on an external SIR-model-based worst case scenario that contained a death toll of 100,000 people (1.1% of the Austrian population).\n\nSuch scenarios are problematic due to the high levels of uncertainty of long-term (multiple weeks and months) case number forecasts; a generic feature of mathematical epidemiological models which has been put under the spotlight by the COVID-19 pandemic [44, 45, 40, 42]. Based on our results, we argue that a main benefit of epidemiological models comes from their use as short-term monitoring systems. The models are typically calibrated to the infection dynamics of the last couple of days or weeks and forward project this dynamic based on epidemiological parameters often assumed to be fixed. If a short-term forecast is accurate this means that infection numbers have continued as expected, based on the recent trend and accurate assumptions. In our forecasts, as shown in Fig. 2, this holds true for some but not all time periods. If the short-term forecast severely over- or underestimates the observed dynamics, one should inquire more closely what might have caused this change.\n\nInaccurate short-term forecasts, therefore, signal a change in the epidemiological situation that needs to be explained. This occurred, for instance, when our forecasts in August 2020 consistently underestimated the observed case numbers. At this point, contact tracing data revealed a growing number of travel associated cases mainly from hotspots in South Eastern Europe contributed substantially to this unexpected increase in infections [34]. In response, novel border restrictions for persons entering Austria from these countries were put in place at the end of August. During the summer 2020, infection numbers increased from around 20 confirmed cases per day to about 200 cases, mostly driven by patients aged below 40 years. Consequently, the number of severe COVID-19 cases remained low and the effective rate to require intensive care dropped to one percent and below. The situation changed qualitatively in September, when not only case numbers started to soar again, but also hospital admissions increased much more strongly than\n\nFig. 5: **Example for a reporting template of our out-of-sample forecasts.** The visual reports consist of four panels. First, we report the daily number of cases in absolute terms and the weekly case numbers per 100 000 population as well as the forecasts for the weekly case numbers, including CIs. Additional panels show the the effective reproduction number and the forecasts for intensive and normal care beds occupancy with COVID-19 patients along with the corresponding CIs.\n\n projected. Our analysis revealed that the driver behind the observed above-forecast ICU occupancy was above-forecast total case numbers, while age-specific ICU rates remained constant in our models. In other words, the bed usage forecasts were inaccurate because of the infection number forecast, but not because the characteristics of the detected cases changed in terms of severity (e.g., age or more symptomatic or severe cases).\n\nAt the onset of the second COVID-19 wave in Austria in October 2020 the forecasts influenced policy debate and contributed to the decision of implementing a second lockdown. The forecast of October 30 predicted an increase in ICU occupancy by COVID-19 patients from 263 to 681 (34% of total ICU capacity of 2,007 beds) within the next 15 days and stressed that capacity limits of around 700 to 800 ICU beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients may be exceeded by mid to end of November if this trend would be unbroken. Additionally, the heterogeneous trend across Austrian federal states - leading to regions with COVID-19 ICU occupancy rates of more than 50% - was emphasized[46]. In a speech in the Main Committee of the National Council the Austrian Federal Minister of Health emphasized the dynamic of the second wave. Referring to the forecast of October 30 which predicted an increase in daily case numbers up to 6,300 by November 7 and a critically high level of ICU occupancy rate, the Minister called for a second lockdown[47, 6]. While actual ICU occupancy first remained below the forecast (e.g. 585 vs. 681 on November 14) the call for action turned out to be appropriate as the Austrian intensive care system operated around its capacity limit with a maximum of 709 ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients a bit later on November 25 according to available information.\n\nAfter relaxing NPIs during December 2020 the forecasts also contributed to the third lockdown after Christmas where persistently high levels of ICU occupancy rates were predicted and concerns regarding the seasonal increase in contacts which may lead to a further increase in occupancy rates were raised[48].\n\nIn total, within the study period we observed three waves. The models anticipated the peaks or at least a substantial flattening of the curves in wave 1 and 2 but failed to anticipate the observed flattening of the third wave. The models also predicted the onset of the third wave while the early growth of the second wave was substantially stronger than forecasted. As discussed, the peaks of the first two waves where the result of hard lockdowns, while the third wave broke in several Austrian regions without a substantial strengthening of NPIs, most likely due to seasonal influences. This can also be seen in Fig. 2, where the effective reproduction number continued to decrease on May and June 2021 at a time where NPIs were gradually eased. The onset of the third wave, however, coincided with the takeover of the Alpha variant in Austria, which was successfully anticipated by the models. Taken together, these findings suggest that mechanistic epidemiological model can foresee certain types of turning points (e.g., due to NPIs or the emergence of more transmissible variants), while further research is needed to integrate other classes of drivers, such as changes in mobility[22] or meteorological factors[33].\n\nOne might question whether complex epidemiological models are necessary for such a short-term forecast-based monitoring system or whether the use of simpler models could not serve a similar purpose. Indeed, models that are not of the compartmental type but use other prediction algorithms, ranging from ARIMA[50, 49] to deep learning[51, 52], have also been applied to forecast the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The advantage of using compartmental epidemiological models is that they also provide a mechanistic description of why changes in the current epidemiological situation are occurring. In particular, as a consortium we were frequently asked by policy-makers to provide estimates for possible future epidemiological developments given a certain NPI would be implemented in a few days or not. To answer such requests, it is beneficial to use models allowing to directly simulate the effects of hypothetical interventions. Such questions can be even more reliably and consistently answered if the same model is used to produce short-term forecasts as a baseline scenario and a hypothetical scenario assuming the implementation of a new NPI.\n\nOur forecast-based decision support comes with limitations. First, the weekly prognosis is partly based on shared data from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Internal Affairs which comes with quality and reporting bias limitations. Moreover, even though the consortium has access to the most accurate and up-to-date data about the epidemic in Austria, a lot of information required for valid epidemiological forecasting is not available or only available with considerable delay, since adequate reporting systems are not in place; e.g., the fraction of undetected persons due to asymptomatic disease progression. Further, our forecast is based on simulation models which are generally subject to errors that come from abstraction and simplification of the real system. Through the harmonized handling of three models with entirely different approaches we attempted to reduce such structural uncertainties. Finally, our decision support framework is mostly limited by its political and public visibility. According to our experience, our forecast was of special public and policy interest in periods of rapid movements but also had a confirmatory effect in times of decreasing case numbers or slow growth with respect to taken policy measures.\n\nIn conclusion, we argue that modellers need to be cautious and responsible in communicating the sometimes strongly speculative nature of their results and their uncertainties to politicians and the public. Short-term epidemiological models can be valuable ingredients of a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to detect epidemiological change points, identify their potential causes, and thereby inform decisions to ease or strengthen governmental responses.\n\n## Data availability\n\nSARS-CoV-2 case and hospitalization data for Austria is available via the COVID-19 open government data portal under https://www.data.gv.at/covd-19. The data underlying Figs. 1 to 4 in this work can be found in Supplementary Data 1 to 4, respectively.\n\n## Code availability\n\nNo custom code was written for data collection. We describe a reporting system that combines the output from several computational models which have been previously described in the literature; the Extended SIR-X Model[17], the Agent-Based SEIR Model[18] and the Epidemiological State Space Model[7].\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Correa-Martinez, C.

The goal was to assess how likely Austrian ICUs would become overburdened with COVID-19 patients in the upcoming weeks.\n\n**Methods** We consolidated the output of three epidemiological models (ranging from agent-based micro simulation to parsimonious compartmental models) and published weekly short-term forecasts for the number of confirmed cases as well as estimates and upper bounds for the required hospital beds.\n\n**Results** We report on three key contributions by which our forecasting and reporting system has helped shaping Austria's policy to navigate the crisis, namely (i) when and where case numbers and bed occupancy are expected to peak during multiple waves, (ii) whether to ease or strengthen non-pharmaceutical intervention in response to changing incidences, and (iii) how to provide hospital managers guidance to plan health-care capacities.\n\n**Conclusions** Complex mathematical epidemiological models play an important role in guiding governmental responses during pandemic crises, in particular when they are used as a monitoring system to detect epidemiological change points.\n\n[1]Institute of Information Systems Engineering, TU Wien, Favoritenstrasse

S.\n\n\n\n## Article\n\n* [1] The first known COVID-19 cases in Austria appeared at the end of February 2020 together with one of the first European superspreading events in the Tyrolean tourist region of Ischolv, visited by travellers from all over the globe [1]. In the first half of March 2020, a nationwide spread of the virus occurred with an exponential rise of confirmed cases [2]. These developments occurred against the dramatic backdrop of the neighbouring country of Italy, where despite strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) case numbers kept surging, hospital capacities were exceeded and the military had to assist the health authorities [3, 4]. To understand how likely similar developments would have been in Austria, mid-March a forecast consortium was formed and tasked by the government with a weekly forecasting of the expected developments in case numbers and how these developments would translate into demand for healthcare resources. The overarching policy goal at this stage was to navigate the crisis without overburdening the Austrian healthcare system. Over the summer, this was also given a legal basis with a clause in the Austrian COVID law that stay-at-home orders may only be implemented if healthcare capacities are in danger of becoming exhausted [5]. The Austrian Corona Commission, an advisory committee to the minister of health tasked with assessment of epidemiological risk, defined that ICUs would be able to cope with situations in which up to 33% of all ICU beds would be occupied by COVID-19 patients [6].\n\nAustria took a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in response to the crisis [7] during the first wave. Next to a ramping up of healthcare and public health capacities, airport restrictions and landing bans intensified in the first week of March. Gatherings were limited to 500 persons, cultural and other events started to be cancelled on March 10. On March 16, Austria went into a full lockdown with schools, bars, restaurants, and shops being closed, as well as a transitioning into home office for all non-essential employees [8]. Together with other, earlier measures, these NPIs effectively led to a rapid reduction of daily infection numbers. The number of new cases per day reached a first peak on March 26 with 1,065 cases [8]. In the first wave, COVID-19 related hospitalizations peaked on March 31 with 912 regular beds, whereas the ICU utilization peaked on April 8 with 267 beds (roughly 10% of the overall capacity) being occupied by COVID-19 patients. Daily new cases decreased over April after which they fluctuated at values below one hundred until July [9].\n\nStarting in July 2020, case numbers in Austria started to increase again leading to a second wave in October. In response to this rise of case numbers, the Austrian government implemented a series of lockdowns with varying levels of stringency since beginning of November 2020. Hospitalizations peaked in the end of November, with 3,985 regular beds occupied on November 24, and 709 ICU beds occupied on November 25, respectively. According to officially reported data, this peak brought Austrian hospitals very close to the critical limit of 33% ICU bed occupancy by COVID patients.\n\nThe Austrian COVID-19 forecast consortium provided weekly short-term forecasts for case numbers and required hospital beds. In particular, the role of the forecast consortium was to forecast how likely the 33% threshold of ICU beds being occupied by COVID-19 patients would be crossed within our forecast horizon. Our consortium consisted of three independent modelling teams with experience in the use and development of mathematical and computational models to address epidemiological and public health challenges [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The consortium was complemented with experts from the Ministry of Health, the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety, as well as external public health experts in weekly meetings.\n\nA plethora of epidemiological models to forecast the spread of COVID-19 has been proposed recently [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. In the forecast consortium, we consolidated the output of three models into a single forecast of case numbers for 8-14 days and used these case numbers to predict the numbers of required hospital and ICU beds for 21 days for the country as a whole and for each of its nine federal states. In addition to these point estimates, we also provided upper and lower bounds for these numbers at various levels of confidence. These upper bounds of the hospital bed forecasts served as a guidance system for the regional hospital managers, allowing them to estimate how many beds should be reserved for COVID-19 patients if they were willing to accept a given level of risk. These forecasts have been published each week on the homepage of the Ministry of Health [23].\n\nThe idea of using a harmonized epidemiological forecast became popular for influenza prognoses [24] and was recently also adapted for COVID-19 forecasts by the European Center for Disease Control [25]. For influenza, the strategy has already been shown to be superior to results of individual models with respect to forecasting errors. Moreover, since the results are highly relevant for policy-making, this strategy also allowed for risk-sharing between the involved institutions making up the consortium.\n\nWhile the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has triggered an explosive growth of epidemiological forecasting models, substantially less research has been performed regarding how the results of such models should be disseminated for decision support [26, 27, 28]. In this work, therefore, we present the forecast and reporting system we developed based on the three independent forecasting models to support policy making in Austria. While the individual models have been adapted from pre-existing works, our main novelty lies in developing a reporting system to communicate relevant output to non-technical experts and to inform decisions regarding strengthening or easing NPIs.\n\nAfter a brief summary of the individual models and strategies to combine their output, we describe the accuracy of our forecasts and how this accuracy depended on the phase of the epidemics (i.e., in high or low incidence phases, during waves, etc.). We consistently find that the combined forecasts were more accurate than any of the individual forecasts for three different strategies of combining them. Substantial over- or underestimations of the actual development typically occurred in all models simultaneously and sometimes signalled epidemiological change points. We discuss how our results were received by policy-makers, stakeholders in the healthcare system, and the public. We outline the main contributions of our approach to chart a safe path to re-open the country after the first lockdown and how the system informed the necessity for a second lockdown in November 2020. The aim of this work is to communicate the methods applied and developed which allowed three individually thinking modelling and simulation research units to work together in a joint task force producing a consolidated forecast, the benefits and shortcomings of the process, and the political impact of the achieved results. We conclude that epidemiological models can be useful as the basis for short-term forecast-based monitoring systems to detect epidemiological change points which in turn inform on the necessity to strengthen or ease NPIs.\n\n## Methods\n\nWe used three conceptually different epidemiological COVID-19 models, developed and operated individually by three research institutions, namely a modified SIR-X differential equation model (Medical University of Vienna / Complexity Science Hub), an Agent-Based simulation model (TU Wien/dwh GmbH), and an epidemiological state space model (Austrian National Public Health Institute).\n\n* **Data.** Although the three models use different parameters and parametrization routines, they are calibrated using the same datato generate weekly forecasts. Consequently, differences between the model forecasts are a result of different model structure and calibration, but not a result of different data sources. The models also used different nowcasting approaches to correct for late reporting of positive test results. We used data from the official Austrian COVID-19 disease reporting system (EMS[9]). The system is operated by the Austrian Ministry of Health, the federal administrations, and the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety.\n\nFor every person tested positively in Austria, the EMS contains information on the date of the test, date of recovery or death, age, sex and place of residence. Furthermore, hospital occupancy of COVID-19 patients in ICU and normal wards are available from daily reports collected by the Ministry for Internal Affairs.\n\nWe declare that our research does not require ethics approval. We used an existing secondary dataset maintained as database to collect the information needed. It includes anonymous information and it is not possible to link data in order to generate identifiable information. Data are properly anonymised. The information is legally accessible and appropriately protected by law.\n\n**Extended SIR-X model.** One of our models is an extension of the recently introduced SIR-X model[17]. The original SIR-X model introduced a parsimonious way to extend the classic SIR dynamics with the impact of NPIs. In particular, two classes of NPIs are considered. First, there are NPIs that lead to a contact reduction of all individuals (susceptible and infected ones). Such NPIs include social distancing and other lockdown measures. Second, the model also represents NPIs that reduce the effective duration of infectiousness for infected individuals. Contactracting and quarantine belong to this category.\n\nThe model was extended by adding mechanisms by which susceptible but quarantined individuals increase their number of contacts again as well as waning immunity; we refer to this model as the XSIR-X model. The model further includes an age-structured population. Model parameters are calibrated using a numerical optimization procedure that is separately performed in multiple time windows corresponding to phases with different regimes of NPIs. Whether changes in NPIs indeed led to substantial changes in behaviour was inferred from mobility data to identify such calibration time windows[29, 30]. A more detailed technical model description can be found in Supplementary Note 2.\n\n**Agent-based SEIR model**. The second model is an Agent-Based SEIR type model, furthermore abbreviated as AB model. In this section we will only give a rough overview of this model. For a detailed and technical model description (about 20 pages long) including all used parameter values we refer to previous published work (see supplemental material in [13]). Since the model is subject to continuous improvements, the model description is continuously updated and found at http://www.dwh.at/en/projects/covid-19/.\n\nThe AB model is stochastic, population-dynamic and depicts every inhabitant of Austria as one model agent. It uses sampling methods to generate an initial agent population with statistically representative demographic properties and makes use of a partially event-based, partially time-step (1 day)-based update strategy to enhance in time.\n\nThe model is based on a validated population model of Austria including demographic processes like death, birth, and migration[15]. Contacts between agents are responsible for disease transmission and are sampled via locations in which agents meet: schools, workplaces, households and leisure-time. After being infected, agents go through a detailed disease and/or patient pathway that depicts the different states of the disease and the treatment of the patient.\n\nThe model input consists of a time-line of modelled NPIs; parameters are calibrated using a modified bisection method. For generation of the weekly forecasts, the model is fitted to the 7 day incidence of the new confirmed cases of the last 21 days including a nowcasting correction for the last week to supplement for subsequent registrations.\n\nResults are gathered via Monte-Carlo simulations as the point-wise sample mean of multiple simulation runs. Due to the large number of agents in the model, eight simulation runs are used which are sufficient to have the sample mean approximate the real unknown mean with an error of less than 1% with 95% confidence (estimated by the Gaussian stopping as introduced in ref. [31]).\n\nThe model considers uncertainty with respect to the stochastic perturbations in the model by tracing the standard deviation of the Monte-Carlo simulations. Parameter uncertainty is considered in form of manually defined best and worst case scenarios.\n\n**Epidemiological state space model**. The third model isolates weekday effects, statistical outliers and exogenous shocks in order accurately identify and extrapolate the current trend in reported new infections.\n\nWe therefore use a multivariate autoregressive state space model, where reported numbers of daily new infections (including corrections for exogenous shocks and nowcasting for the recent days) are explained by underlying latent factors (\"states\") and exogenous variables.\n\nThe basic structure of the model follows a random walk of order 2 and includes weekday effects that may change over time. Further information can be incorporated into the model by defining exogenous variables. The coefficients of these effects are not determined in the model but extracted from external sources. Currently, exogenous data included in the model comprise the effective immunization rate of the population, seasonal effects, number of imported cases, and NPI.\n\nEffective immunization rates are calculated as the share of immunized individuals (vaccinated and/or recovered) times the corresponding empirically estimated effectiveness of protection against reported infections based on the screening method[32]. Seasonal forcing is modelled by the cosine function, with a maximum positive impact on transmission rates in January. The magnitude of seasonal effects are based on literature estimates[33]. The number of imported cases is based on Austrian contact-tracing data[34]. NPIs are incorporated based on information on NPIs in place at federal and regional level[15] and their reported effects on transmission rates[36].\n\nFor a more technical model description refer to Supplementary Note 2.\n\n**Model harmonization**. In order to harmonize the model output and generate a single consolidated forecast for the number of new and accumulated positive COVID-19 tests, each model was set up to generate its output in a common data format for each of the nine federal states of Austria. Our forecasts consisted of time series of confirmed cases for each day starting with the number of positive tests at the day of the forecast consortium meeting at 11:59 pm and ending between 8 and 14 days in the future (over time, we slightly increased the forecast horizon).\n\nDifferent averaging procedures were considered to generate the joined forecast from the three individual forecasts. These included the point-wise arithmetic and geometric mean as well as an adaptive weighting procedure wherein the timeseries for each model contributes with weights proportional to the accuracy of its most recent forecasts. This strategy was adapted from previous work [24, 37]. The following three strategies have been evaluated in terms of their forecast error. Let \\(F_{i}^{i}(t)\\) denote the forecasts for the total number of COVID-19 cases on day \\(t\\) for model \\(j\\) for runs made in week \\(i\\),\n\n\\[F_{i}^{h}(t)=f(F_{i}^{h}(t),F_{i}^{h}(t),F_{i}^{h}(t))\\] (1)\n\nthe harmonized forecast with strategy \\(f_{i}\\) and \\(R_{i}\\) the corresponding reported number.\n\n* **Naive**. This strategy describes a static arithmetic average \\[f(F_{i}^{1}(t),F_{i}^{2}(t),F_{i}^{3}(t)):=\\frac{1}{3}F_{i}^{1}(t)+\\frac{1}{3} F_{i}^{2}(t)+\\frac{1}{3}F_{i}^{3}(t)\\] (2)\n* **Geometric**. This strategy describes the static geometric average of the forecasts. \\[f(F_{i}^{1}(t),F_{i}^{2}(t),F_{i}^{3}(t)):=\\sqrt{F_{i}^{1}(t)F_{i}^{2}(t)F_{i} ^{3}(t)}\\] (3)\n* **Continuously weighted dynamic mean**. This strategy describes a dynamically weighted arithmetic average. \\[f(x,y,z):=a_{i}^{1}F_{i}^{1}(t)+a_{i}^{2}F_{i}^{2}(t)+a_{i}^{3}F_{i}^{3}(t)\\] (4) The weights are determined from the forecasting errors of the previous three weeks. \\[a_{i}^{j}=\\frac{1}{3}\\sum\\limits_{k=(i-3)}^{i-1}w_{k}^{j},\\quad w_{k}^{j}= \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\max(|y\\bar{F}-R_{k}|,0.5)}{\\max(|\\bar{F}-R_{k}|,0.5)}}\\,,j\\in \\{1,2,3\\}.\\] (5)\n\nHospital bed usage model.Hospital occupancy is modelled in a stock-flow approach, in which the \"stock\" of hospital patients is changed over time by means of an in- and outflow of patients. Inflow (admission to ICU and normal wards) is calculated as a ratio of the time-delayed number of recently reported and projected new cases from the harmonized model forecast. Length of stay determines outflow. Admission rates are scaled in order to fit the current occupancy in all federal states. The scaling parameter (one for each federal state) can thus be interpreted as an effective hospitalization rate. Model parameters were initially extracted from literature [38] and subsequently calibrated to observational data to better fit the observed time series; see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2. Length of stay is modelled based on the empirical distribution of length of stay with a cut-off value of maximum 100 days. The hospital bed usage model is stratified by four age groups and sex as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Mean average length of stay for admissions in the period January to May 2021 (and discharges in the period January to June 2021) was 13.4 for ICU stays and 10.7 for normal ward stays.\n\nConfidence intervals for forecasts.Confidence intervals (CIs) for both case numbers of the harmonized model and hospital occupancy are derived from the empirical forecast error of each prognosis day. More specific, we retrospectively evaluate the ratio of the consolidated forecast and the observed seven-day-incidence rate of confirmed cases for each day over the forecast interval. The upper and lower limits of the 68% and 95% CIs used for the reporting of our forecasts are derived from the corresponding percentiles of the empirical distribution of the observed forecast error.\n\nIt is assumed that forecasting errors can be reasonably approximated by a log-normal distribution that is independent of the starting level of case numbers, that the variance increases with the forecast horizon, and that the forecast error of the first and second day of the forecast is skewed because increases due to delayed reporting are more likely than decreases in case numbers due to backdating. We therefore consider the relative logarithmic forecast error tuples \\(\\tilde{x}_{i,h}\\) where \\(i\\) denotes the number of the prognosis, and \\(h\\) denotes the forecast horizon. These tuples are evaluated in a 2-dimensional kernel-density estimation (KDE). The resulting density function is evaluated at slices of \\(h=1,2,\\ldots,H\\), where \\(H\\) is the last day of the forecast. 0.025, 0.16, 0.84 and 0.975 percentiles give thresholds for the error bands in the case number projections for \\(h\\).\n\nFor the confidence intervals of the ICU and hospital occupancy we additionally take the occupancy on the first prognosis day into account because the fluctuations of the occupancy numbers played a much higher role for the error than the parameter uncertainty. Specifically, an almost linear relation between the level of uncertainty and the square root of the occupancy on the first prognosis day could be observed.\n\nWe regard the tuples \\(Y_{i,j}=(\\Delta_{i,j},\\sqrt{X_{i}})\\). Hereby, \\(\\Delta_{i,j}\\) denotes the logarithmic error \\(\\log(X_{i,j}/\\tilde{X}_{i,j})\\) between the reported occupancy \\(X_{i,j}\\) and the forecast occupancy \\(\\tilde{X}_{i,j}\\) of day \\(j\\) in prognosis week \\(i\\). Furthermore \\(X_{i,j}=X_{i,h}=\\tilde{X}_{i,0}\\) denotes the occupancy on the day of the prognosis in week \\(i\\). The tuples \\(Y_{i,j}\\) are evaluated in a 2-dimensional kernel-density estimation (KDE) using Scott's Rule to obtain the kernel function \\(f(\\Delta,\\sqrt{X})\\).\n\nTo generate CIs, the marginal distributions\n\n\\[f_{\\sqrt{X}}(\\Delta)=\\frac{f(\\Delta,\\sqrt{X})}{\\int_{\\Delta}\\!f(u,\\sqrt{X})du}\\]\n\nare calculated numerically. Finally, the percentiles of \\(f_{\\sqrt{X}}(\\Delta)\\) give the CIs for the logarithmic error, given a certain occupancy \\(X\\) on the day of the prognosis.\n\nForecasting error evaluation.Forecasts are evaluated at the weekly official meetings of the consortium. A list of all dates (as well as officially reported forecasts) can be found online [23]. To quantify the error of the case forecasts, the total number of reported and projected new cases since the last meeting are compared using data as reported on the day of the meeting. For example, the forecast harmonized on April 3, 2020 was evaluated on the meeting on April 10th by comparing the total number of new cases reported between April 3rd and April 9th with the projected ones.\n\nTo avoid bias, relative and not absolute differences and errors are taken into account.\n\nReporting summary.Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### ", "Forecasting positive test numbers": "\n\nWe show the results for our rolling forecasts compared with the actual case numbers in Fig. 1 for 72 forecasts. For the time period from April 4 to Summer 2021, we performed and harmonized weekly forecasts that are visibly as bundles of lines in Fig. 1. The first published forecasts coincided closely with the peak of the first epidemic wave in Austria. While the models showed a clearly discernible divergence for the first forecast, the agreement increased over the first wave. The starting points for the early weekly forecasts occasionally lie below the actual cases due to a substantial amount of very late reporting of cases in these early periods of the epidemic. From May until July, reported cases remained at a comparably low level.\n\n Starting from late August to early September, the onset of the second wave is visible. A critical point was the prognosis for the week until October 25, highlighted in yellow in Fig. 1. There, the consolidated forecast clearly underestimated the actual rise in confirmed cases. The forecasts made in the weeks thereafter were more accurate, however, the CI strongly increased due to the less accurate forecasts from the first half of October. A gradual flattening of the curve until end of January can be observed after the steep increase in November, during which the forecasts had a tendency to overestimate the degree of the flattening.\n\nThe early increase of the third wave in March 2021 was anticipated by the models due to the alpha variant becoming dominant. However, the peak of the third wave was not anticipated, as were the substantial decreases in reported cases in the following weeks when possibly seasonal factors increasingly curbed the virus spread.\n\nIn Fig. 2, we compare the model-specific forecast error with the forecast error of the consolidated model, the incidence and the effective reproduction number in Austria. In April 2020, agreement amongst the three models is typically stronger than the agreement with the data, meaning if one model over- or underestimated the actual trend, so did the other models. After the summer, agreement between the three models was larger than in the early phases of the pandemic. Comparing the upper and lower part of this image also shows that none of the models anticipated a spontaneous rise in \\(R_{\\text{eff}}\\) in combination with a large number of daily cases in August/September and October. This was particularly well visible at end of October (see the dotted lines in Fig. 2). Nevertheless, the violin representation in Fig. 3, which shows the relative differences between forecasts and reported data of all forecasts ever made, indicates that no persistent systematic over- or underestimation occurs while it cannot be ruled out that such systematic aberrations might have occurred over smaller periods of time.\n\nWe investigated the performance of different averaging procedures that weigh models according to their past performance in terms of their relative difference and error, see Methods. The results are summarized in Table 1. Performance weighting procedures yielded only a marginal improvement over simple averaging in terms of forecast accuracy. This further corroborates that agreement amongst the model forecasts is typically higher than their agreement with the observed case numbers.\n\n \n\nTable 1: Forecast accuracy with different model harmonization strategies.\n\nFig. 3: **Evaluation of the forecasting performance for federal states.** The distribution of relative differences over all 72 forecasts to the reported data for Austria (AT) and all nine federal states (AT-1 to AT-9) is shown. Since the mean relative differences are close to zero, no persistent systematic over or underestimation of the cases occurs. For large federal states such as Lower Austria (AT-3) and Vienna (AT-9), forecasts are more reliable. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 3.\n\nFig. 2: **Evaluation of the forecast performance.** Daily new confirmed cases and estimated \\(R_{\\text{eff}}\\)\\({}^{9}\\) (top panel) and forecasting performance (relative difference, bottom panel) of the individual models and the harmonized mean are shown for 72 forecasts. Weeks in which the forecasts substantially underestimated the actual case numbers (vertical dotted lines) tend to coincide with steep increases in \\(R_{\\text{eff}}\\). The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 2.\n\n patients. There are three peaks in ICU bed occupancy corresponding and delayed with respect to the peaks in case numbers. The red dashed line gives the threshold of 33% of all ICU beds being in use for COVID-19 patients. We highlight again (yellow in Fig. 4) the forecast for the week until October 25, in which we severely underestimated the developments. After adjusting the models for these developments, the next forecast projected that the 33% threshold would likely be crossed in two to three weeks. After the second peak passed, the model showed a tendency to overestimate the pace at which patients would be released from ICU. Forecast accuracy during the third wave was overall much higher for the ICU forecast compared to the forecasts of the case numbers.\n\n**Reporting of the forecasts.** We developed a standard reporting template to communicate our forecasts to other stakeholders and decision-makers, see Fig. 5. These visual reports showed our forecasts for cases and hospital occupancy, as well as information on the effective reproduction number. The visual reports are complemented by a brief synopsis of the researcher's appraisal of the current situation and particularities of the most recent forecast. These appraisals are publicly accessible [23]. Furthermore, the researchers are at disposal for any questions that members of the health ministers' office or the regional crisis management units may have.\n\nThe first panel in Fig. 5 provides an outlook for the expected developments in weekly cases (per 100,000 population). Due to known weekday effects, we do not give forecasts for daily case numbers. Expected hospital occupancy is given in the second panel. All forecasts are supplemented with 68% and 95% confidence intervals. The forecasts are also presented in the weekly sessions of the Austrian Corona Commission, an advisory body to the minister of health tasked with assessing the epidemiological risk in Austria. The expected occupancy rates of ICU is an indicator in assessing the risk of health system overburdening and thus directly contributes to the classification of Austrian regions according to this risk, which in turn informs recommendations on easing or strengthening control measures[6].\n\n## ", "Discussion": "\n\nConsidering the impact of COVID-19 policy measures on economic and social life, any related decision support needs to be done with caution. Our approach considers the high impact of COVID-19 forecasts by (1) focusing on monitoring rather than long-term prognosis and (2) consolidation of three different \"model opinions\" which not only improved the quality of the short-term forecast, but also distributed the responsibility of the decision support on multiple teams.\n\nFrom the very beginning of our work as consortium, we decided to publish only short-term forecasts and to refrain from\n\nFig. 4: Forecasting bed usage. Rolling combined and consolidated out-of-sample forecasts for the number of intensive care beds currently in use for COVID-19 patients including corresponding CI, the actual numbers of beds occupied, and 33% of total ICU capacity as a reference. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 4.\n\n publishing longer-term scenarios. Due to the multiplicative growth of uncertainties in epidemiological models, accurate forecasts are typically only possible over a time horizon of several days [39, 40, 41, 42]. There is no meaningful way to estimate the uncertainty for long-term scenarios that span over several weeks, months or even years. For policy-makers and non-technical experts, the distinction between a prognosis with a defined level of certainty and a hypothetical what-if experiment is hard to communicate.\n\nOur forecasts provided evidence for the expected total number of daily infections and hospitalized cases including appraisals of uncertainty via forecast intervals. This is in contrast to what has been popularly described as \"worst case coronavirus science\", i.e. the communication of worst case scenarios as baselines in the public pandemic management strategy [43]. For instance, the UK policy change toward adopting more drastic NPIs on March 23 was based on worst case scenarios created by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team that within the current policy regime 250,000 deaths were to be expected. In a press conference in April, the Austrian chancellor publicly stated that soon \"everyone will know someone who died because of COVID-19\", based on an external SIR-model-based worst case scenario that contained a death toll of 100,000 people (1.1% of the Austrian population).\n\nSuch scenarios are problematic due to the high levels of uncertainty of long-term (multiple weeks and months) case number forecasts; a generic feature of mathematical epidemiological models which has been put under the spotlight by the COVID-19 pandemic [44, 45, 40, 42]. Based on our results, we argue that a main benefit of epidemiological models comes from their use as short-term monitoring systems. The models are typically calibrated to the infection dynamics of the last couple of days or weeks and forward project this dynamic based on epidemiological parameters often assumed to be fixed. If a short-term forecast is accurate this means that infection numbers have continued as expected, based on the recent trend and accurate assumptions. In our forecasts, as shown in Fig. 2, this holds true for some but not all time periods. If the short-term forecast severely over- or underestimates the observed dynamics, one should inquire more closely what might have caused this change.\n\nInaccurate short-term forecasts, therefore, signal a change in the epidemiological situation that needs to be explained. This occurred, for instance, when our forecasts in August 2020 consistently underestimated the observed case numbers. At this point, contact tracing data revealed a growing number of travel associated cases mainly from hotspots in South Eastern Europe contributed substantially to this unexpected increase in infections [34]. In response, novel border restrictions for persons entering Austria from these countries were put in place at the end of August. During the summer 2020, infection numbers increased from around 20 confirmed cases per day to about 200 cases, mostly driven by patients aged below 40 years. Consequently, the number of severe COVID-19 cases remained low and the effective rate to require intensive care dropped to one percent and below. The situation changed qualitatively in September, when not only case numbers started to soar again, but also hospital admissions increased much more strongly than\n\nFig. 5: **Example for a reporting template of our out-of-sample forecasts.** The visual reports consist of four panels. First, we report the daily number of cases in absolute terms and the weekly case numbers per 100 000 population as well as the forecasts for the weekly case numbers, including CIs. Additional panels show the the effective reproduction number and the forecasts for intensive and normal care beds occupancy with COVID-19 patients along with the corresponding CIs.\n\n projected. Our analysis revealed that the driver behind the observed above-forecast ICU occupancy was above-forecast total case numbers, while age-specific ICU rates remained constant in our models. In other words, the bed usage forecasts were inaccurate because of the infection number forecast, but not because the characteristics of the detected cases changed in terms of severity (e.g., age or more symptomatic or severe cases).\n\nAt the onset of the second COVID-19 wave in Austria in October 2020 the forecasts influenced policy debate and contributed to the decision of implementing a second lockdown. The forecast of October 30 predicted an increase in ICU occupancy by COVID-19 patients from 263 to 681 (34% of total ICU capacity of 2,007 beds) within the next 15 days and stressed that capacity limits of around 700 to 800 ICU beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients may be exceeded by mid to end of November if this trend would be unbroken. Additionally, the heterogeneous trend across Austrian federal states - leading to regions with COVID-19 ICU occupancy rates of more than 50% - was emphasized[46]. In a speech in the Main Committee of the National Council the Austrian Federal Minister of Health emphasized the dynamic of the second wave. Referring to the forecast of October 30 which predicted an increase in daily case numbers up to 6,300 by November 7 and a critically high level of ICU occupancy rate, the Minister called for a second lockdown[47, 6]. While actual ICU occupancy first remained below the forecast (e.g. 585 vs. 681 on November 14) the call for action turned out to be appropriate as the Austrian intensive care system operated around its capacity limit with a maximum of 709 ICU beds occupied by COVID-19 patients a bit later on November 25 according to available information.\n\nAfter relaxing NPIs during December 2020 the forecasts also contributed to the third lockdown after Christmas where persistently high levels of ICU occupancy rates were predicted and concerns regarding the seasonal increase in contacts which may lead to a further increase in occupancy rates were raised[48].\n\nIn total, within the study period we observed three waves. The models anticipated the peaks or at least a substantial flattening of the curves in wave 1 and 2 but failed to anticipate the observed flattening of the third wave. The models also predicted the onset of the third wave while the early growth of the second wave was substantially stronger than forecasted. As discussed, the peaks of the first two waves where the result of hard lockdowns, while the third wave broke in several Austrian regions without a substantial strengthening of NPIs, most likely due to seasonal influences. This can also be seen in Fig. 2, where the effective reproduction number continued to decrease on May and June 2021 at a time where NPIs were gradually eased. The onset of the third wave, however, coincided with the takeover of the Alpha variant in Austria, which was successfully anticipated by the models. Taken together, these findings suggest that mechanistic epidemiological model can foresee certain types of turning points (e.g., due to NPIs or the emergence of more transmissible variants), while further research is needed to integrate other classes of drivers, such as changes in mobility[22] or meteorological factors[33].\n\nOne might question whether complex epidemiological models are necessary for such a short-term forecast-based monitoring system or whether the use of simpler models could not serve a similar purpose. Indeed, models that are not of the compartmental type but use other prediction algorithms, ranging from ARIMA[50, 49] to deep learning[51, 52], have also been applied to forecast the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The advantage of using compartmental epidemiological models is that they also provide a mechanistic description of why changes in the current epidemiological situation are occurring. In particular, as a consortium we were frequently asked by policy-makers to provide estimates for possible future epidemiological developments given a certain NPI would be implemented in a few days or not. To answer such requests, it is beneficial to use models allowing to directly simulate the effects of hypothetical interventions. Such questions can be even more reliably and consistently answered if the same model is used to produce short-term forecasts as a baseline scenario and a hypothetical scenario assuming the implementation of a new NPI.\n\nOur forecast-based decision support comes with limitations. First, the weekly prognosis is partly based on shared data from the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Internal Affairs which comes with quality and reporting bias limitations. Moreover, even though the consortium has access to the most accurate and up-to-date data about the epidemic in Austria, a lot of information required for valid epidemiological forecasting is not available or only available with considerable delay, since adequate reporting systems are not in place; e.g., the fraction of undetected persons due to asymptomatic disease progression. Further, our forecast is based on simulation models which are generally subject to errors that come from abstraction and simplification of the real system. Through the harmonized handling of three models with entirely different approaches we attempted to reduce such structural uncertainties. Finally, our decision support framework is mostly limited by its political and public visibility. According to our experience, our forecast was of special public and policy interest in periods of rapid movements but also had a confirmatory effect in times of decreasing case numbers or slow growth with respect to taken policy measures.\n\nIn conclusion, we argue that modellers need to be cautious and responsible in communicating the sometimes strongly speculative nature of their results and their uncertainties to politicians and the public. Short-term epidemiological models can be valuable ingredients of a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system to detect epidemiological change points, identify their potential causes, and thereby inform decisions to ease or strengthen governmental responses.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nSARS-CoV-2 case and hospitalization data for Austria is available via the COVID-19 open government data portal under https://www.data.gv.at/covd-19.

The traditional approach involves open reduction and the implantation of a steel symphyseal plate (SP) on the public bone to hold the reposition. Despite its widespread use, SP-fixation is often associated with implant failure caused by screw loosening or breakage.\n\n**Methods** To address the need for a more reliable surgical intervention, we developed and tested two titanium cable-clamp implants. The cable served as tensioning device while the clamp secured the cable to the bone. The first implant design included a steel cable anterior to the public symphysis to simplify its placement outside the pelvis, and the second design included a cable encircling the public symphysis to stabilize the anterior pelvic ring. Using highly reproducible synthetic bone models and a limited number of cadaver specimens, we performed a comprehensive biomechanical study of implant stability and evaluated surgical feasibility.\n\n**Results** We were able to demonstrate that the cable-clamp implants provide stability equivalent to that of a traditional SP-fixation but without the same risks of implant failure. We also provide detailed ex vivo evaluations of the safety and feasibility of a trans-obturator surgical approach required for those kind of fixation.\n\n**Conclusion** We propose that the developed cable-clamp fixation devices may be of clinical value in treating public symphysis separation.\n\n \n\n###### Abstract\n\n**Symphyscal disruption and plate fixation.** Rupture of the public symphysis is a traumatic pelvic injury in which the strong midline union of the public bones tears apart, requiring surgical fixation whenever the stability of the pelvis is impaired. Currently, the preferred treatment option is open reduction and symphyscal plate (SP) fixation using a steel plate and screws [1, 2, 3]. Despite the technique being used for decades in orthopedic traumatology, there is a severe hazard of SP implant failure and recurrent gapping. Loosening and breakage are some of the common complications (Supplementary Fig 1). Some patients present only with mild radiologically verifiable plate loosening with an acceptable functional outcome (30-75%), whereas others require surgical revision and have a poorer outcome (3-11%) [4, 5, 6, 7]. Reasons for the high failure rate are controversially discussed. Some experts suspect wrong indications rather than deficits of the implant. However there is progressive data showing that SP fixation is disadvantageous because it does not adequately neutralize the forces on the public symphysis during mobilization of the patient throughout the healing phase [8, 9].\n\n**Biomechanical considerations of symphyscal plating.** Previous biomechanical studies confirmed that SP fixation is unable to achieve stability similar to the uninjured public symphysis [8, 9, 10]. In young patients with good bone quality SP fixation can secure stability for several weeks until fibroatralge healing of the public symphysis sets in. Whenever screw anchoring is impaired, for instance in osteoporoptic bone, risk of implant failure rises before healing is completed [11, 12]. Therefore, SP fixation might not be the ideal treatment option for all patients. The ongoing search for alternative techniques underscores the controversy surrounding SP fixation. Future tapes [13, 14], percutaneous screws [15], and the use of spine implants for internal fixation [16, 17] are just some of the recently introduced alternative fixation techniques. The current literature confirms that there is a need for an alternative fixation device without the risk of screw loosening or plate breakage.\n\n**Hypothesis of an alternative fixation technique**. Early reports about wire fixation of the public symphysis exist, a technique without the risk of screw loosening or breakage [18, 19]. Fixation in which a wire is passed through the adjacent bone of the public symphysis or through the obtructor foramen are reported. The limited tensile strength of wires is one of the reasons why such wire fixation is outdated in the meantime. Better fixation strength of braided steel cables renewed the discussion about cable fixation of the public symphysis [20, 21]. However, a cable alone is at risk for dislocation and loosening because it lies solely on the bony surface without ossees fixation [20]. Therefore, an anchoring device for the cable seems to be required. The purpose of this study was to develop different anchoring devices that allow a cable as tensioning element to stabilize the public symphysis. The two anchoring devices tested here differ in their methods of stabilizing the public symphysis and were therefore separately evaluated. The cable-clamp anterior only (CCAO) design located the cable only on one side of the public symphysis to simplify cable placement outside the pelvis. The cable-clamp anterior and posterior (CCAP) design stabilized the anterior pelvic ring using a cable encircling the public symphysis to provide a potentially higher stability than that supplied by the CCAO design.\n\nWe hypothesized that cable-clamp fixation would be a possible alternative to SP fixation. We conducted an equivalence and non-inferiority testing to proof effectiveness of the developed implant devices compared to SP-fixation but with better properties such as fewer risk of implant failure or less invasive implantation [22]. To obtain sufficient data for statistical analysis of our approach, we first used a comprehensive synthetic bone model because it is available in unlimited quantities and is highly reproducible. Next, we conducted a smaller biomechanical cadaver study to simulate conditions in vivo. Although cadaver specimens are difficult to obtain and have a greater variability, combining both methods in a two-phase testing regime provides a more complete biomechanical understanding. Further, a cadaver study was conducted to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the trans-obtructor surgical implantation. We were able to confirm equivalent stability of SP fixation and both cable-clamp prototypes.\n\n**Materials and methods Implant manufacturing**. To address the need for a more reliable surgical intervention, we developed and tested two titanium cable-clamp implants. The implant system consisted of a tensile steel cable and two clamps, each clamp possessing a cable-guiding channel and a large opening to attach the clamp to the bone using a screw. The two implant designs differed in the path of their guiding channels, with the CCAO design having the guiding channel on only one side of the clamp and the CCAO design having the guiding channel running along both sides. The purpose of the clamp was to attach the cable to the bone, securely guide the cable close to the bone, increase the contact area of the cable and the bone, and avoid cable loosening. Clamps were planned with mirror symmetry and a clockwise thread. After trialing different prototypes, we fabricated slim, anatomically contoured clamps (Fig. 1) by combining selective laser sintering with a new metal/binder powder feedstock and industrial processes such as conventional sintering, a technique called cold-metal-fusion 3D printing (CMF). Commercially available titanium powder (Ti6Al4V) was suited to this purpose and integrated into the binder system as required. After a processable feedstock was established, test specimens were produced to assess their density and chemical composition. Because the clamp overhang depended on the bone geometry, incorporation of support structures within the design was trialed. Afterward, test damps were printed using selective laser sintering (Formiga P110, EOS, Germany). The binder was then dissolved using furnace heating, leaving a solid metal implant. Compensation for shrinkage during this process was calculated in advance (Supplementary Fig. 2) [23, 24].\n\n**Biomechanical testing of synthetic bone models.** Thirty synthetic pelvis (Pelvis Complete, Art. No. 4060, Synbone, Zizers, Switzerland) were used in our biomechanical study. We justify the use of synthetic bone models with its widely accepted use in biomechanical laboratories and its recent utilization in similar pelvic studies allowing comparability of our results [13, 25, 26, 27, 28]. An anterior-posterior compression injury (Young and Burgess APC II; OTA/AO: 61-B2.3d) was simulated [29, 30], leading to disruption of the public symphysis and the liposomal connections. Fixation of posterior instability was conducted in all specimens using a partially threaded stainless steel screw (\\(\\diameter\\) 6.5 mm, 95 mm long) on the right sacrollaic joint. The disrupted synthetic bone models were divided into three groups. The control group underwent SP fixation (Group SP; \\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) using a four-hole stainless steel symphys plate (SymphysDial Plate 3.5 Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland; Art. No. 02.100,004) and four self-tapping, non-locking cortex screws (\\(\\diameter\\) 3.5 mm, Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Medial and lateral screws were 55 mm and 60 mm long, respectively. Attention was paid to the length and convergence angle of the screws to avoid their penetration through the cortical bone. Public symphysis disruption in Group CCAO (\\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) was fixed using the CCAO device by securing each V-shaped clamp to the crani-medial edge of opposing obturator foramin with a fully threaded stainless steel screw (M4; \\(\\diameter\\) mm, 20 mm long). After fixation,the public rami were reduced using a pointed reduction clamp, then a steel braided cerclage cable (\\(\\approx\\) 1.7 mm, Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was pulled through the anterior guiding channels of the clamps. Finally, the centrally crossed cerclage cable was pre-tensioned using a cable tensioning device to reduce the symphysis, with care taken to ensure that the tension forces were equal. After anatomical reduction, the cramp was deformed and locked using a ratcheting cable crimper and shortened to a minimum using a cable cutter. Public symphysis disruption in Group CCAP (\\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) was fixed using the CCAP device by looping the cable through the obturator foramina, following the guiding channels of the clamps, then tensioned, secured, and shortened. Thus, the symphysis was looped with the cable cerc-lag twice. All specimens were examined using X-ray imaging to verify similar implant positioning (Fig. 2).\n\nFor biomechanical testing setup we used a single-leg-stance model as it is simple, has minimal risk for confounders, and it is well established by other groups [31, 32]. Hereby vertical sheer stress can be applied to the public symphysis but no traction. Different biomechanical test set-ups are mentioned in the literature, like the two-leg-stance with simultaneous load or with alternating load, but all have separate limitations [9, 33]. The pelvic models were fixed to the material testing machine (Z020, Zwick/Roell GmbH, Ulm, Germany) using a custom-made aluminum device connected to a force transducer. Pelvic samples were attached via the sacrum at a physiological 45\\({}^{\\circ}\\) tilt. The acetabulum articulated with a hemiarthoplasty femoral head prosthesis (\\(\\sigma\\) 48 mm), and the physiological anterostogen angle of 15\\({}^{\\circ}\\) was taken into account. In addition, a hook system was attached to the right ileum to simulate the musculus tensor facise late and the tractous liithials. A series of pre-tests were performed, using up to 12,000 test cycles and load levels up to 600 N, until a final test protocol was defined (Table 1A). The testXpert II software (Version 3.6, Zwick/Roell GmbH) continuously recorded force and displacement to generate a load-displacement curve and measure the following parameters: peak-to-peak displacement (mm), total displacement (mm), plastic deformation (mm), and stiffness (N/mm). A coordinate system was prepared by attaching round visual markers (1.5 mm i.d., 3.5 mm o.d). In one plane, and an optical measuring system (ARAMIS 3D Professional, Carl Zeiss GOM Metrology GmbH, Braunschweig. Germany) equipped with two 6 MP cameras/a 12 MP sensor (GOM) and ARAMIS Professional software 2018/2019 (Carl Zeiss GOM Metrology GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) was linked to the material testing machine and used to follow the movement of the markers.The visual markers served as identifiers at different anatomical landmarks for the 12 megapixel cameras/sensor and a reference block (140 \\(\\times\\) 22 \\(\\times\\) 32 mm) with three point markers was defined as coordinate system as a reference. This enabled the displacement of the individual visual markers to be measured in \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) axis. For measurement, the 30 visual measuring points were divided into the following point components: coordinate system, femur, right symphysis, left symphysis, right sacroiliac joint, and left sacroiliac joint (Supplementary Fig. 3). Calibration was performed before each test and accuracy was confirmed (0.3-0.03 mm). Among the several visual measuring points, we determined those on either side of the symphysis to be most relevant, and we referred to it as symphysical displacement (mm). This parameter allows to indirect measure movement of the pelvic ring. The optical measuring system was adjusted and coupled to the material testing machine to record the maximum loads of the 10 setting cycles during pre-testing, the first measuring cycle, and every 20th measuring cycle up to the 5000th (Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 1: **Cable-clamp fixation devices for stabilization of a ruptured public symphysis.** The cable-clamp anterior only (CCAO) design positions the cable anterior to the symphysis. The cable-clamp anterior and posterior (CCAP) design requires the cable to encircle the public symphysis. Both clamps contain cable-guiding surface channels and large openings for screw placement.\n\n \n\n**Biomechanical testing of cadaver bone models.** No approval of the ethics committee of the University of Wurzburg was necessary for the description of the surgical technique and biomechanical testing outlined in this article. Informed consent to participate in research questions was given and all cadavers were anonymized for this project. Six fresh-frozen cadaver pelvic bones were used for biomechanical analysis (3 male, 3 female). Exitrpation of the full pelvis was carried out, and all muscular attachments were removed. The ligamentum sacrotuberale and ligamentum sacrospinale were dissected on one side of the pelvis and retained on the other. The public symbiosis and the anterior sacroiliac ligament were incised to create an anterior-posterior compression type II injury. Three specimens were stabilized using the CCAO fixation device and three were stabilized using the CCAO device. The human pelvis was attached to the biomechanical testing setup in a manner similar to that of the synthetic bone models but without hook attachment to the right ileum, and biomechanical testing was performed on the same day as fixation. In this special setting we decided against the ileum attachment to observe movement at the anterior pelvic ring without limitation. The optical measuring system was activated, and the test protocol was adapted for cadaver specimens (Table 1B).\n\n**Establishment of a trans-obturator approach using a cadaver model.** Six fresh-frozen cadaver specimens underwent the following sequence of surgical steps: incision of the symphysis plus, implantation of the medical device (Supplementary Videos 1-4), soft tissue closure, computed tomography (CT) scanning (bladder filled with radiocontrast fluid), full anatomical dissection, and final exitrpation of the pelvis. State-of-the-art twin-beam CT (SOMATOM Definition Edge; Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) or photon-counting CT (NAEOTOM Alpha; Siemens Healthcare GmbH) scanners were used for cadaveric pelvis imaging (Table 2). Scan parameters were chosen to optimize image quality. Prefiltration techniques (Au+Sn 120 kV/Sn 140 kV) were used to minimize streak artifacts caused by the metal implants. In addition to conventional CT, cytograms were acquired using a standard Foley catheter. Therefore, iodine contrast agent (Imeron 350; Bracco Imaging Deutschland GmbH, Germany) diluted with water (1:5) was injected into the urinary bladder to rule out bladder or ureth laceration. Irrespective of the scanner used, reconstructions in axial, coronal, and sagittal orientations were performed employing a sharp bone kernel. The slice thickness and increment were chosen with 1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. Additionally, cinematic volume rendering was performed using dedicated software (syngo.via VB60, Siemens Healthcare GmbH).\n\n**Statistics and reproducibility.** A power analysis was performed using a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% to confirm that the sample size for synthetic bone models was adequate. The results are presented as mean values with standard deviation. All data underwent statistical analysis for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Analysis of variance was used to compare the means. A post hoc test was not necessary because no difference was measurable. A \\(P\\) value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Further, data acquired using the synthetic bone model underwent equivalence and non-inferiority testing. Use of confidence intervals is preferred for statistical testing of non-inferiority (i.e., equivalence or superiority). Calculation of confidence intervals requires data to have a normal distribution\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}  & **Cycles** & **Maximum** & **Minimum** & **Frequency** \\\\ A) Synthetic bone & & & & \\\\\n1.

Colored arrows in panels (**B** and **D**) indicate movements along the y-axis. The number of cycles used to test cadaver bones was lower than that used for testing the synthetic bone models because of the limited time available after cadaver specimens were defrosted.\n\n and homogenous variance, which we assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. When necessary, a square root transformation of the data was performed to ensure that test requirements were satisfied. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (Supplementary Data 1).\n\n**Reporting summary**. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Implant manufacturing and handling**. Solid titanium implants with CCAO and CCAP designs were manufactured using CMF. The thread of the opening for screw insertion was hand-cut to improve accuracy. Biomechanical testing showed that the CCAO device was easier to handle than the CCAP device. The extra-pelviciple cable in the CCAO device ran smoothly along the guiding structure on the surface of the clamp, thereby reducing the risk of irritating surrounding anatomical structures, and the intrapelviciple part of the implant was small and fully covered by soft tissue in the cadaver specimens. Cable placement in the CCAP device was slightly more cumbersome. In contrast to the synthetic bone model, the cable could only pass once around the pubic symphysis in the cadaver because limited visual access made threading it through the posterior cable guide of the in situ implant difficult (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Vigorous use of an oversized cable passer bears the risk of bladder laceration as observed in one case. In a gapping traumatic sympspsynel rupture, retraction of the bladder might enable the cable to be more safely passed. We decided to perform an additional cranial midline incision between the pyramidalis muscles to improve visualization (Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Provided one is aware of\n\nFig. 4: **Results of the synthetic bone model biomechanical testing \u2013 box plots (\\(N=10\\)).** The material testing machine generated a load-displacement curve from which peak-to-peak displacement, plastic deformation, total displacement, and stiffness were measured under two different cyclic load levels.

Nevertheless, bladder laceration is a hazard and is not specific to the implant presented here [34, 35].\n\nBiomechanical analysis of the synthetic pelvic bone modelThe peak-to-peak displacements of the entire pelvic ring were \\(0.83\\pm 0.33\\) mm (SP), \\(0.72\\pm 0.44\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.74\\pm 0.37\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(1.31\\pm 0.80\\) mm (SP), \\(1.02\\pm 0.59\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.89\\pm 0.30\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(400\\) N. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could not be proved under either load. Non-inferiority of the CCAP device compared with the SP device could be proved under \\(400\\) N load but not \\(300\\) N (Fig. 4 & 5; Table 3).\n\nThe total displacements of the pelvic ring were \\(4.31\\pm 0.83\\) mm (SP), \\(4.15\\pm 0.81\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(4.04\\pm 0.93\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(5.25\\pm 1.14\\) mm (SP), \\(5.06\\pm 1.19\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(4.44\\pm 0.85\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(400\\) N. Non-inferiority of both the CCAO and CCAP devices compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions.\n\nPlastic (irreversible) deformation of the whole pelvic ring was determined using the load-displacement curve and the measured values were \\(1.05\\pm 0.35\\) mm (SP), \\(0.94\\pm 0.40\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.95\\pm 0.36\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(1.36\\pm 0.60\\) mm\n\nFig. 5: **Results of the synthetic bone model biomechanical testing - non-inferiority testing.

Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could not be proved under either loading condition. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could be proved under 300 N load but not 400 N.\n\nStiffness values were determined from the slope of the load-displacement curve during the fifth cycle and measured to be \\(136.15\\pm 23.55\\) N/mm (SP), \\(134.83\\pm 21.47\\) N/mm (CCAO), and \\(146.13\\pm 27.87\\) N/mm (CCAP) under 300 N load and \\(133.15\\pm 22.53\\) N/mm (SP), \\(135.21\\pm 240.2\\) N/mm (CCAO), and \\(150.36\\pm 28.81\\) N/mm (CCAP) under 400 N. Non-inferiority of both CCAO and CCAP devices compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions.\n\nSymphsel displacements were determined using 3D optical analysis and measured to be \\(0.92\\pm 0.21\\) mm (SP), \\(0.89\\pm 0.19\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.92\\pm 0.27\\) mm (CCAP) under 300 N load and \\(1.22\\pm 0.28\\) mm (SP), \\(1.15\\pm 0.28\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(1.02\\pm 0.15\\) mm (CCAP) under 400 N. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions, whereas the CCAP device was non-inferior only under the load of 400 N.\n\n**Biomechanical analysis of the cadaver pelvic bone model**. All cadaver tests were conducted under a load of 300 N (Table 1B). The peak-to-peak total pelvic displacements were \\(2.62\\pm 2.18\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(2.72\\pm 1.26\\) mm (CCAP). Total displacements were \\(9.50\\pm 0.87\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(4.94\\pm 1.26\\) mm (CCAP). Plastic deformations were \\(3.05\\pm 1.85\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(3.27\\pm 1.47\\) mm (CCAP). Stiffness values were \\(191.59\\pm 62.45\\) N (CCAO) and \\(119.87\\pm 53.54\\) (CCAP). The mean symbolical displacements were \\(1.29\\pm 0.89\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(1.83\\pm 0.70\\) mm (CCAP). Non-inferiority testing was not conducted for the cadaver specimens because of the small sample size (Fig. 6).\n\n**Establishment of a trans-obturator approach using a cadaver model**. The cadavers were positioned in a supine position on a flat table, and a Foley catheter was inserted. A midline or horizontal incision (8-10 cm long) was made directly anterior to the public symphysis. During preparation through the skin and soft tissue to the public symphysis, the Serratic cord or round ligament were spared. Subsequently, the public symphysis was dissected. To expose the medial border of the obturator foramen, the pectines and external obturator muscle were partially detached. Trans-obturator access to the pelvic cavity was gained by careful digital dissection though the obturator membrane and the internal obturator muscle including the fascia. The puborectal muscle was also pierced. This procedure was performed on both sides of the pelvis to enable the fingerting to access the posterior part of the public symphysis. Visual access was limited because of the intact symphysis. The clamps of the implant were manually placed at the medial border of the obturator foramen under visual control. Intrapelvic palpation using the index finger confirmed no incarceration of the bladder. A 1.7 mm braided steel cable was passed through the guiding channels of the clamps, which were secured to the pubs by drilling and screw fixation. Using the tensioning device, the cable was tightened to compress the public symphysis. The tension and position of the cable were secured by deformation of the clamp, as recommended by the manufacturer (Cable System, Surgical Technique, DePuy Synthes). The cable was shortened and tissue layers were closed above the symphysis (Supplementary Videos 1-4).\n\nThe surgical approach for implanting the CCAP device was different from that of the CCAO device to enable the cable to be passed around the posterior side of the public symphysis (Fig. 7). We additionally performed a 3 cm cranial extension next to the public symphysis along the midline of the pyramidalis muscles. When entering the pelvic cavity via the Retzius space, the bladder could be retracted and the cable passed safely. After wound closure, all specimens were evaluated using CT, and then2 fully dissected. The following anatomical structures were at risk (Fig. 8): the artery, vein, and nerve inside the obturator canal; the sperratic cord or round ligament; the lilionginal nerve; the genitemoral nerve (genital branch); the suspensiony ligament of the penis; superficial dorsal vein of the penis; clitoral glass and body; the bladder and prostate; and the femoral artery, vein, and nerve. The full cadaver dissection showed a well-fitting implant sufficiently distanced from surrounding anatomical structures. The content of the muscular and vascular lacunae was laterally far from the operating area. The obturator nerve came closest to the implant. The lilionginal and the genitofemoral nerves had variable shapes and locations and could not be identified in all specimens. In male subjects, the sperratic cord was free from contact with the implant. In one cadaver, bladder laceration was identified (Fig. 9). Postoperative cadaver CT analysis confirmed a good implant fit to the public bone (Fig. 10). Both clamp types were located at the cranial-medial border of the obturator foramen, and there was sufficient distance to the obturator canal. There was no contact between the bladder (filled with iodine contrast agent) and the implant. Between the implant and the bladder was adipose tissue. The Foley catheter was clearly visible,\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline\n**Parameter** & **Group** & **Mean** & **STD** & **\\(P\\)-value** \\\\ \\hline Stiffness [N & SP & 136.2 & 23.6 & 0.535 \\\\ /mm] 300 N & CCAO & 134.8 & 21.5 & \\\\  & CCAP & 146.1 & 27.9 & \\\\ Stiffness [N & SP & 133.2 & 22.5 & 0.268 \\\\ /mm] 400 N & CCAO & 135.2 & 24.0 & \\\\  & CCAP & 150.4 & 28.8 & \\\\ Peak-to-Peak- & SP & 0.832 & 0.333 & 0.795 \\\\ Displacement & CCAO & 0.722 & 0.442 & \\\\\n[mm] 300 N & CCAO & 0.744 & 0.366 & \\\\ Peak-to-Peak- & SP & 1.309 & 0.799 & 0.292 \\\\ Displacement & CCAO & 1.018 & 0.591 & \\\\\n[mm] 400 N & CCAO & 0.890 & 0.299 & \\\\ Total Displacement & SP & 4.312 & 0.826 & 0.781 \\\\\n[mm] 300 N & CCAO & 4.153 & 0.809 & \\\\  & CCAP & 4.042 & 0.933 & \\\\ Total Displacement & SP & 5.252 & 1.137 & 0.222 \\\\\n[mm] 400 N & CCAO & 5.064 & 1.187 & \\\\  & CCAP & 4.438 & 0.849 & \\\\ Plastic Deformation & SP & 1.050 & 0.354 & 0.768 \\\\\n[mm] 300 N & CCAO & 0.938 & 0.402 & \\\\  & CCAP & 0.951 & 0.362 & \\\\ Plastic Deformation & SP & 1.360 & 0.603 & 0.248 \\\\\n[mm] 400 N & CCAO & 1.132 & 0.564 & \\\\  & CCAP & 0.979 & 0.263 & \\\\ Symphysseal & SP & 0.919 & 0.210 & 0.939 \\\\ Displacement 300 N & CCAO & 0.890 & 0.188 & \\\\  & CCAP & 0.922 & 0.267 & \\\\ Symphysseal & SP & 1.218 & 0.276 & 0.210 \\\\ Displacement 400 N & CCAO & 1.146 & 0.278 & \\\\  & CCAP & 1.023 & 0.152 & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} The results are presented as main values with standard deviation. All data underwent statistical analysis for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test (Cnem normal distribution). Analysis of variance was used to compare the means. A post test test was not necessary because no difference was measurable. A value of these data from 0.05 was confirmed statistically significant. Absence of a significant difference cannot be interpreted as equivalence of the implants. Therefore, the non-inferiority testing was necessary.\n\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Statistical analysis of the synthetic bone models tested by ANOVA.\n\n and the urethra was free from contact with the implant in all cadavers. In male cadavers, there was no contact with the prostate (one specimen had prostatectomy). One female cadaver showed leakage of contrast fluid from the bladder, which was confirmed to be lacerated during the subsequent dissection. Bladder injury most likely occurred during the attempt to implant the CCAP device using a cable passer. Bone density varied between male and female subjects.\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nWe attempted minimally invasive implantation of two medical devices for stabilization of a ruptured symphysis. Using a 3D printing technology, we fabricated solid and stable titanium implants with complex geometric structures.\n\nBiomechanical analysis of synthetic bone models demonstrated that CCAO and CCAP designs were non-inferior to the regular SP fixation when comparing important parameters such as total displacement, symphyseal displacement, and stiffness. For some other parameters, a non-inferiority test could not be conducted using the available data. Biomechanical analyses of cadavers confirmed the findings obtained using the synthetic bone models, but the results were more variable. We observed a trend for higher stability of the CCAP design compared with the CCAO design, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because we did not use a load-to-failure test, it remains to be determined whether the CCAP design has a higher ultimate strength. In our view, the combination of synthetic and cadaver bone models is essential for studying the biomechanics of symphyseal fixation devices. Synthetic bone models are readily available and highly reproducible but have limited capacity to mimic human musculoskeletal conditions[36]. Cadaver bone models are better able to mimic such musculoskeletal conditions but are usually highly variable because of differences among body donors[37]. Comparison of our results to the recent literature confirms a current pursuit of alternative fixation devices. Most recently Hinz et al. developed a flexible implant by combining plates with a fiber cord\n\nFigure 6: **Results of the cadaver biomechanical testing (\\(N=3\\)).** Parameters were similar to those obtained using the synthetic bone model. The material testing machine generated a load-displacement curve from which peak-to-peak displacement, plastic deformation, total displacement, and stiffness were measured under two different cyclic load levels. The optical system measured changes in separation of the public branches (symphyseal displacement). Sample sizes were smaller and SP fixation was not evaluated.

Bohler et al. applied suture buttons as alternative fixation in a comprehensive cadaver study and found no inferiorly compared to plating [39]. Kiskaddon et al. confirmed feasibility of suture button fixation of the pubic symphysis in their cadaver study [40]. Cavalcanti-Kussmaul et al. explored suture tape fixation of the pubic symphysis and yielded promising results in a synthetic bone model test set-up and cadaver test model [13, 41]. In contrast to the mentioned studies we decided to use a braided steel cable as tensioning device. Even so the use of modern suture material seems also reasonable. Further, the question arises whether the cable used here could be applied without the presented clamps. In a previous study we confirmed that transducer cable fixation is feasible in a synthetic bone model. Preliminary clinical cases in which the technique was applied in combination with sympsysal plating shows promising results. However, we fear loosening of the cable when used without an anchoring device because the ongoing micromotion may cause the braided cable to cut into the bone [40].\n\nIn addition to the biomechanical analyses, we demonstrated safe placement of the implants next to the pubic symphysis using a trans-obturator approach. Our anatomical study identified a safe anatomical area for implant placement and highlighted structures at risk. Immediate hazards such as bladder laceration were described in detail and precautions to avoid such collateral injury were noted. Development of orthopedic implants such as those presented here is closely linked to advancements in implant manufacturing. Implant designs and manufacturing procedures become obsolete whenever better surgical techniques or fabrication processes emerge. The current standard treatment is SP-fixation; however, implant failure is often reported as previously mentioned [42, 43, 44, 11, 47, 14]. Steel plates were originally intended to stabilize bony fractures until osseous healing could be completed; therefore, their suitability for stabilizing a dynamic, joint-like union such as the pubic symphysis is debatable. Screw detachment or loosening and plate breakage can occur when sympsysal micromotion is high, which in our experience arises especially among non-compliant, elderly, or obese patients [11]. Our CCAO or CCAO designs may therefore be advantageous because they do not rely on screw fixation. Fabrication of these implants was enabled using a modern 3D printing technology, which has greatly enhanced metal-based orthopedic prototype development. The case of 3D printing and its ability to realize complex design structures makes it ideal for implant research, especially using CMF. Ultra-fast production of a dedicated cable-clamp implant using patient-specific medical imaging data may be implemented in the future [45]. Although our implant geometries were designed based on synthetic bone models, they fitted well to the cadaver specimens so that scaling of the existing clamp sizes may also be sufficient. The synthetic binder poses no concerns for biocompatibility and stability because debinding and sintering removes all remnants; however, implant manufacture using more established techniques, such selective laser melting or electron-beam melting, is also an option because some are already FDA-approved [46].\n\nThe trans-obturator surgical approach is necessary to implant the CCAO and CCAO devices but not generally established in orthopedic surgery. Operating through the obturator foramen has been shown to be safe in other surgical specialites [47, 48]. In our anatomical study, none of the cadavers had a ruptured symphysis and all had an intact rectus abdominis. Therefore, visualization through the symphysis into the true pelvis was impaired. Supportive cranial midline incision was needed to improve visual access but might be unnecessary under real conditions in which the pubic symphysis is gapping. As previously described by Hadeed et al., some important anatomical structures must be considered [49]. In particular, the spermatic cord and ligamentum sensorarium penis in men and the round ligament, clitord body, and clitord glass in women must be spared to prevent dysperunia, erectile dysfunction, or infertility [50, 51, 52, 53]. During our dissection, we identified no conflict with the abovementioned structures. The spermatic cord was sufficiently distant, but its\n\nFig. 9: **Risk of bladder laceration during surgical procedure.** Bladder laceration might result from vigorous application of an oversized curved cable passer during trans-obturator surgery with limited visibility. **A** Bladder laceration was observed in our cadaver study, where an oversized cable passer was used to transfer the cable from one side to the other. The bladder injury was confirmed by (**B**) visual inspection during preparation, and observation of (**C**) extravasation of contrast fluid around the pubic symphysis and (**D**) entrapped air in the bladder in computed tomography (**CT**) images obtained before full anatomical dissection.\n\n position in a trauma context might differ so reduction clamps or a cable passer should be used with caution [52]. Regarding the uniferous structures, the urethra runs underneath the public symphysis. The Foley catheter could be palpated and was outside the operating area. Structures of the obturator canal are at the lateral border of the foramen and were usually several centimeters from the clamp. The trans-obturator approach may be considered an extension of previously described minimally invasive techniques such as the Fu-Liu approach [54]. To place the implant, a cable must be passed through muscles such as the pectin, addductors, obturator externus and interuns, and part of the levator an: The risk of herniation is unknown.\n\nThe following limitations of our work should be considered: We used a single-leg stance model for our study because in our experience it mimics implant loosening of the public symphysis and clinical postoperative non-weightbearing. However, some authors reasonably argue that a bilateral-leg stance model better creates distraction forces at the public symphysis and shear forces through the saccroliic joint [55, 56, 57, 58]. Furthermore, the number of our cyclic loadings may have been inadequate. Six weeks of daily walking would amount to approximately 210,000 cycles, greater than the number tested here [58]. Our pre-tests were conducted using a larger number of cyclic loads during which diminishing differences were seen, but some disadvantages of the cable-clamp device might not have been apparent. Our synthetic pelvic model had no ligaments or muscular attachments, and the load vectors would differ under real-life conditions. Nevertheless, synthetic bone models are established and well-accepted precursors to\n\nFig. 10: **Implant evaluation by computed tomography.** Top: **(A-C)** CT images of the CCAO device implanted at the public symphysis. **D**, **E** Sagittal and axial CT images of the intact bladder filled with contrast fluid. **F**, **G** Enlarged images showing the good implant fit to the bone, anterior placement of the cable, and screws fixing the clamp to the bone.

Screw and plate fixation in our study was performed without a drilling template that would otherwise improve conformity of the implantation [25, 26]. Use of the CCAO and CCAO devices is limited to public symphyseal rupture, and fracture of the public rami disqualifies any type of cable-clamp fixation. Finally, we acknowledge that analogous approaches such as trans-osseous wiring of the symphysis have previously been described [18, 19, 61, 62]. Successful biomechanical fixation has been achieved using various alternative techniques [13, 14, 15, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, option?

The traditional approach involves open reduction and the implantation of a steel symphyseal plate (SP) on the public bone to hold the reposition. Despite its widespread use, SP-fixation is often associated with implant failure caused by screw loosening or breakage.\n\n**Methods** To address the need for a more reliable surgical intervention, we developed and tested two titanium cable-clamp implants. The cable served as tensioning device while the clamp secured the cable to the bone. The first implant design included a steel cable anterior to the public symphysis to simplify its placement outside the pelvis, and the second design included a cable encircling the public symphysis to stabilize the anterior pelvic ring. Using highly reproducible synthetic bone models and a limited number of cadaver specimens, we performed a comprehensive biomechanical study of implant stability and evaluated surgical feasibility.\n\n**Results** We were able to demonstrate that the cable-clamp implants provide stability equivalent to that of a traditional SP-fixation but without the same risks of implant failure. We also provide detailed ex vivo evaluations of the safety and feasibility of a trans-obturator surgical approach required for those kind of fixation.\n\n**Conclusion** We propose that the developed cable-clamp fixation devices may be of clinical value in treating public symphysis separation.\n\n \n\n###### Abstract\n\n**Symphyscal disruption and plate fixation.** Rupture of the public symphysis is a traumatic pelvic injury in which the strong midline union of the public bones tears apart, requiring surgical fixation whenever the stability of the pelvis is impaired. Currently, the preferred treatment option is open reduction and symphyscal plate (SP) fixation using a steel plate and screws [1, 2, 3]. Despite the technique being used for decades in orthopedic traumatology, there is a severe hazard of SP implant failure and recurrent gapping. Loosening and breakage are some of the common complications (Supplementary Fig 1). Some patients present only with mild radiologically verifiable plate loosening with an acceptable functional outcome (30-75%), whereas others require surgical revision and have a poorer outcome (3-11%) [4, 5, 6, 7]. Reasons for the high failure rate are controversially discussed. Some experts suspect wrong indications rather than deficits of the implant. However there is progressive data showing that SP fixation is disadvantageous because it does not adequately neutralize the forces on the public symphysis during mobilization of the patient throughout the healing phase [8, 9].\n\n**Biomechanical considerations of symphyscal plating.** Previous biomechanical studies confirmed that SP fixation is unable to achieve stability similar to the uninjured public symphysis [8, 9, 10]. In young patients with good bone quality SP fixation can secure stability for several weeks until fibroatralge healing of the public symphysis sets in. Whenever screw anchoring is impaired, for instance in osteoporoptic bone, risk of implant failure rises before healing is completed [11, 12]. Therefore, SP fixation might not be the ideal treatment option for all patients. The ongoing search for alternative techniques underscores the controversy surrounding SP fixation. Future tapes [13, 14], percutaneous screws [15], and the use of spine implants for internal fixation [16, 17] are just some of the recently introduced alternative fixation techniques. The current literature confirms that there is a need for an alternative fixation device without the risk of screw loosening or plate breakage.\n\n**Hypothesis of an alternative fixation technique**. Early reports about wire fixation of the public symphysis exist, a technique without the risk of screw loosening or breakage [18, 19]. Fixation in which a wire is passed through the adjacent bone of the public symphysis or through the obtructor foramen are reported. The limited tensile strength of wires is one of the reasons why such wire fixation is outdated in the meantime. Better fixation strength of braided steel cables renewed the discussion about cable fixation of the public symphysis [20, 21]. However, a cable alone is at risk for dislocation and loosening because it lies solely on the bony surface without ossees fixation [20]. Therefore, an anchoring device for the cable seems to be required. The purpose of this study was to develop different anchoring devices that allow a cable as tensioning element to stabilize the public symphysis. The two anchoring devices tested here differ in their methods of stabilizing the public symphysis and were therefore separately evaluated. The cable-clamp anterior only (CCAO) design located the cable only on one side of the public symphysis to simplify cable placement outside the pelvis. The cable-clamp anterior and posterior (CCAP) design stabilized the anterior pelvic ring using a cable encircling the public symphysis to provide a potentially higher stability than that supplied by the CCAO design.\n\nWe hypothesized that cable-clamp fixation would be a possible alternative to SP fixation. We conducted an equivalence and non-inferiority testing to proof effectiveness of the developed implant devices compared to SP-fixation but with better properties such as fewer risk of implant failure or less invasive implantation [22]. To obtain sufficient data for statistical analysis of our approach, we first used a comprehensive synthetic bone model because it is available in unlimited quantities and is highly reproducible. Next, we conducted a smaller biomechanical cadaver study to simulate conditions in vivo. Although cadaver specimens are difficult to obtain and have a greater variability, combining both methods in a two-phase testing regime provides a more complete biomechanical understanding. Further, a cadaver study was conducted to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the trans-obtructor surgical implantation. We were able to confirm equivalent stability of SP fixation and both cable-clamp prototypes.\n\n**Materials and methods Implant manufacturing**. To address the need for a more reliable surgical intervention, we developed and tested two titanium cable-clamp implants. The implant system consisted of a tensile steel cable and two clamps, each clamp possessing a cable-guiding channel and a large opening to attach the clamp to the bone using a screw. The two implant designs differed in the path of their guiding channels, with the CCAO design having the guiding channel on only one side of the clamp and the CCAO design having the guiding channel running along both sides. The purpose of the clamp was to attach the cable to the bone, securely guide the cable close to the bone, increase the contact area of the cable and the bone, and avoid cable loosening. Clamps were planned with mirror symmetry and a clockwise thread. After trialing different prototypes, we fabricated slim, anatomically contoured clamps (Fig. 1) by combining selective laser sintering with a new metal/binder powder feedstock and industrial processes such as conventional sintering, a technique called cold-metal-fusion 3D printing (CMF). Commercially available titanium powder (Ti6Al4V) was suited to this purpose and integrated into the binder system as required. After a processable feedstock was established, test specimens were produced to assess their density and chemical composition. Because the clamp overhang depended on the bone geometry, incorporation of support structures within the design was trialed. Afterward, test damps were printed using selective laser sintering (Formiga P110, EOS, Germany). The binder was then dissolved using furnace heating, leaving a solid metal implant. Compensation for shrinkage during this process was calculated in advance (Supplementary Fig. 2) [23, 24].\n\n**Biomechanical testing of synthetic bone models.** Thirty synthetic pelvis (Pelvis Complete, Art. No. 4060, Synbone, Zizers, Switzerland) were used in our biomechanical study. We justify the use of synthetic bone models with its widely accepted use in biomechanical laboratories and its recent utilization in similar pelvic studies allowing comparability of our results [13, 25, 26, 27, 28]. An anterior-posterior compression injury (Young and Burgess APC II; OTA/AO: 61-B2.3d) was simulated [29, 30], leading to disruption of the public symphysis and the liposomal connections. Fixation of posterior instability was conducted in all specimens using a partially threaded stainless steel screw (\\(\\diameter\\) 6.5 mm, 95 mm long) on the right sacrollaic joint. The disrupted synthetic bone models were divided into three groups. The control group underwent SP fixation (Group SP; \\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) using a four-hole stainless steel symphys plate (SymphysDial Plate 3.5 Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland; Art. No. 02.100,004) and four self-tapping, non-locking cortex screws (\\(\\diameter\\) 3.5 mm, Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). Medial and lateral screws were 55 mm and 60 mm long, respectively. Attention was paid to the length and convergence angle of the screws to avoid their penetration through the cortical bone. Public symphysis disruption in Group CCAO (\\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) was fixed using the CCAO device by securing each V-shaped clamp to the crani-medial edge of opposing obturator foramin with a fully threaded stainless steel screw (M4; \\(\\diameter\\) mm, 20 mm long). After fixation,the public rami were reduced using a pointed reduction clamp, then a steel braided cerclage cable (\\(\\approx\\) 1.7 mm, Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was pulled through the anterior guiding channels of the clamps. Finally, the centrally crossed cerclage cable was pre-tensioned using a cable tensioning device to reduce the symphysis, with care taken to ensure that the tension forces were equal. After anatomical reduction, the cramp was deformed and locked using a ratcheting cable crimper and shortened to a minimum using a cable cutter. Public symphysis disruption in Group CCAP (\\(N\\!=\\!10\\)) was fixed using the CCAP device by looping the cable through the obturator foramina, following the guiding channels of the clamps, then tensioned, secured, and shortened. Thus, the symphysis was looped with the cable cerc-lag twice. All specimens were examined using X-ray imaging to verify similar implant positioning (Fig. 2).\n\nFor biomechanical testing setup we used a single-leg-stance model as it is simple, has minimal risk for confounders, and it is well established by other groups [31, 32]. Hereby vertical sheer stress can be applied to the public symphysis but no traction. Different biomechanical test set-ups are mentioned in the literature, like the two-leg-stance with simultaneous load or with alternating load, but all have separate limitations [9, 33]. The pelvic models were fixed to the material testing machine (Z020, Zwick/Roell GmbH, Ulm, Germany) using a custom-made aluminum device connected to a force transducer. Pelvic samples were attached via the sacrum at a physiological 45\\({}^{\\circ}\\) tilt. The acetabulum articulated with a hemiarthoplasty femoral head prosthesis (\\(\\sigma\\) 48 mm), and the physiological anterostogen angle of 15\\({}^{\\circ}\\) was taken into account. In addition, a hook system was attached to the right ileum to simulate the musculus tensor facise late and the tractous liithials. A series of pre-tests were performed, using up to 12,000 test cycles and load levels up to 600 N, until a final test protocol was defined (Table 1A). The testXpert II software (Version 3.6, Zwick/Roell GmbH) continuously recorded force and displacement to generate a load-displacement curve and measure the following parameters: peak-to-peak displacement (mm), total displacement (mm), plastic deformation (mm), and stiffness (N/mm). A coordinate system was prepared by attaching round visual markers (1.5 mm i.d., 3.5 mm o.d). In one plane, and an optical measuring system (ARAMIS 3D Professional, Carl Zeiss GOM Metrology GmbH, Braunschweig. Germany) equipped with two 6 MP cameras/a 12 MP sensor (GOM) and ARAMIS Professional software 2018/2019 (Carl Zeiss GOM Metrology GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) was linked to the material testing machine and used to follow the movement of the markers.The visual markers served as identifiers at different anatomical landmarks for the 12 megapixel cameras/sensor and a reference block (140 \\(\\times\\) 22 \\(\\times\\) 32 mm) with three point markers was defined as coordinate system as a reference. This enabled the displacement of the individual visual markers to be measured in \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) axis. For measurement, the 30 visual measuring points were divided into the following point components: coordinate system, femur, right symphysis, left symphysis, right sacroiliac joint, and left sacroiliac joint (Supplementary Fig. 3). Calibration was performed before each test and accuracy was confirmed (0.3-0.03 mm). Among the several visual measuring points, we determined those on either side of the symphysis to be most relevant, and we referred to it as symphysical displacement (mm). This parameter allows to indirect measure movement of the pelvic ring. The optical measuring system was adjusted and coupled to the material testing machine to record the maximum loads of the 10 setting cycles during pre-testing, the first measuring cycle, and every 20th measuring cycle up to the 5000th (Fig. 3).\n\nFig. 1: **Cable-clamp fixation devices for stabilization of a ruptured public symphysis.** The cable-clamp anterior only (CCAO) design positions the cable anterior to the symphysis. The cable-clamp anterior and posterior (CCAP) design requires the cable to encircle the public symphysis. Both clamps contain cable-guiding surface channels and large openings for screw placement.\n\n \n\n**Biomechanical testing of cadaver bone models.** No approval of the ethics committee of the University of Wurzburg was necessary for the description of the surgical technique and biomechanical testing outlined in this article. Informed consent to participate in research questions was given and all cadavers were anonymized for this project. Six fresh-frozen cadaver pelvic bones were used for biomechanical analysis (3 male, 3 female). Exitrpation of the full pelvis was carried out, and all muscular attachments were removed. The ligamentum sacrotuberale and ligamentum sacrospinale were dissected on one side of the pelvis and retained on the other. The public symbiosis and the anterior sacroiliac ligament were incised to create an anterior-posterior compression type II injury. Three specimens were stabilized using the CCAO fixation device and three were stabilized using the CCAO device. The human pelvis was attached to the biomechanical testing setup in a manner similar to that of the synthetic bone models but without hook attachment to the right ileum, and biomechanical testing was performed on the same day as fixation. In this special setting we decided against the ileum attachment to observe movement at the anterior pelvic ring without limitation. The optical measuring system was activated, and the test protocol was adapted for cadaver specimens (Table 1B).\n\n**Establishment of a trans-obturator approach using a cadaver model.** Six fresh-frozen cadaver specimens underwent the following sequence of surgical steps: incision of the symphysis plus, implantation of the medical device (Supplementary Videos 1-4), soft tissue closure, computed tomography (CT) scanning (bladder filled with radiocontrast fluid), full anatomical dissection, and final exitrpation of the pelvis. State-of-the-art twin-beam CT (SOMATOM Definition Edge; Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) or photon-counting CT (NAEOTOM Alpha; Siemens Healthcare GmbH) scanners were used for cadaveric pelvis imaging (Table 2). Scan parameters were chosen to optimize image quality. Prefiltration techniques (Au+Sn 120 kV/Sn 140 kV) were used to minimize streak artifacts caused by the metal implants. In addition to conventional CT, cytograms were acquired using a standard Foley catheter. Therefore, iodine contrast agent (Imeron 350; Bracco Imaging Deutschland GmbH, Germany) diluted with water (1:5) was injected into the urinary bladder to rule out bladder or ureth laceration. Irrespective of the scanner used, reconstructions in axial, coronal, and sagittal orientations were performed employing a sharp bone kernel. The slice thickness and increment were chosen with 1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively. Additionally, cinematic volume rendering was performed using dedicated software (syngo.via VB60, Siemens Healthcare GmbH).\n\n**Statistics and reproducibility.** A power analysis was performed using a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% to confirm that the sample size for synthetic bone models was adequate. The results are presented as mean values with standard deviation. All data underwent statistical analysis for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Analysis of variance was used to compare the means. A post hoc test was not necessary because no difference was measurable. A \\(P\\) value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Further, data acquired using the synthetic bone model underwent equivalence and non-inferiority testing. Use of confidence intervals is preferred for statistical testing of non-inferiority (i.e., equivalence or superiority). Calculation of confidence intervals requires data to have a normal distribution\n\n\nTable 1: **A) Material testing protocol used to examine synthetic pelvis models.

A single-leg stance test with uniaxial load was used. **B** Visual markers were placed around the public symphysis and illosacral joints and their motion was tracked using a camera system. The material testing machine measured the displacement of the whole pelvis, whereas optical video analysis was used to measure bone movement at the pupils symphysis. The methods of attachment (**C**) and optical measurement (**D**) of cadaver bones were similar to those used for the synthetic bone models. Colored arrows in panels (**B** and **D**) indicate movements along the y-axis. The number of cycles used to test cadaver bones was lower than that used for testing the synthetic bone models because of the limited time available after cadaver specimens were defrosted.\n\n and homogenous variance, which we assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests, respectively. When necessary, a square root transformation of the data was performed to ensure that test requirements were satisfied. All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article (Supplementary Data 1).\n\n**Reporting summary**. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\n**Implant manufacturing and handling**. Solid titanium implants with CCAO and CCAP designs were manufactured using CMF. The thread of the opening for screw insertion was hand-cut to improve accuracy. Biomechanical testing showed that the CCAO device was easier to handle than the CCAP device. The extra-pelviciple cable in the CCAO device ran smoothly along the guiding structure on the surface of the clamp, thereby reducing the risk of irritating surrounding anatomical structures, and the intrapelviciple part of the implant was small and fully covered by soft tissue in the cadaver specimens. Cable placement in the CCAP device was slightly more cumbersome. In contrast to the synthetic bone model, the cable could only pass once around the pubic symphysis in the cadaver because limited visual access made threading it through the posterior cable guide of the in situ implant difficult (Supplementary Videos 1 and 2). Vigorous use of an oversized cable passer bears the risk of bladder laceration as observed in one case. In a gapping traumatic sympspsynel rupture, retraction of the bladder might enable the cable to be more safely passed. We decided to perform an additional cranial midline incision between the pyramidalis muscles to improve visualization (Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Provided one is aware of\n\nFig. 4: **Results of the synthetic bone model biomechanical testing \u2013 box plots (\\(N=10\\)).** The material testing machine generated a load-displacement curve from which peak-to-peak displacement, plastic deformation, total displacement, and stiffness were measured under two different cyclic load levels. The optical system measured changes in separation of the public branches (symphyseal displacement). White dots = individual data points. Black dots = outlier. Lines in the box and whisker plot = error bars are the 95% confidence interval, the bottom and top of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the line inside the box is the 50th percentile (median).\n\n this problem, we assume that the risk of bladder laceration is manageable. Nevertheless, bladder laceration is a hazard and is not specific to the implant presented here [34, 35].\n\nBiomechanical analysis of the synthetic pelvic bone modelThe peak-to-peak displacements of the entire pelvic ring were \\(0.83\\pm 0.33\\) mm (SP), \\(0.72\\pm 0.44\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.74\\pm 0.37\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(1.31\\pm 0.80\\) mm (SP), \\(1.02\\pm 0.59\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.89\\pm 0.30\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(400\\) N. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could not be proved under either load. Non-inferiority of the CCAP device compared with the SP device could be proved under \\(400\\) N load but not \\(300\\) N (Fig. 4 & 5; Table 3).\n\nThe total displacements of the pelvic ring were \\(4.31\\pm 0.83\\) mm (SP), \\(4.15\\pm 0.81\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(4.04\\pm 0.93\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(5.25\\pm 1.14\\) mm (SP), \\(5.06\\pm 1.19\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(4.44\\pm 0.85\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(400\\) N. Non-inferiority of both the CCAO and CCAP devices compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions.\n\nPlastic (irreversible) deformation of the whole pelvic ring was determined using the load-displacement curve and the measured values were \\(1.05\\pm 0.35\\) mm (SP), \\(0.94\\pm 0.40\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.95\\pm 0.36\\) mm (CCAP) under \\(300\\) N load and \\(1.36\\pm 0.60\\) mm\n\nFig. 5: **Results of the synthetic bone model biomechanical testing - non-inferiority testing. Non-inferiority testing of the synthetic bone models confirmed equivalence of SP and cable-clamp (CCAO or CCAP) fixation methods for several of the test parameters (asterisk). Absence of non-inferiority does not indicate lower stability because the non-inferiority test could not be conducted for some parameters.** (SP), \\(1.13\\pm 0.56\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.98\\pm 0.26\\) mm (CCAP) under 400 N. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could not be proved under either loading condition. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device could be proved under 300 N load but not 400 N.\n\nStiffness values were determined from the slope of the load-displacement curve during the fifth cycle and measured to be \\(136.15\\pm 23.55\\) N/mm (SP), \\(134.83\\pm 21.47\\) N/mm (CCAO), and \\(146.13\\pm 27.87\\) N/mm (CCAP) under 300 N load and \\(133.15\\pm 22.53\\) N/mm (SP), \\(135.21\\pm 240.2\\) N/mm (CCAO), and \\(150.36\\pm 28.81\\) N/mm (CCAP) under 400 N. Non-inferiority of both CCAO and CCAP devices compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions.\n\nSymphsel displacements were determined using 3D optical analysis and measured to be \\(0.92\\pm 0.21\\) mm (SP), \\(0.89\\pm 0.19\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(0.92\\pm 0.27\\) mm (CCAP) under 300 N load and \\(1.22\\pm 0.28\\) mm (SP), \\(1.15\\pm 0.28\\) mm (CCAO), and \\(1.02\\pm 0.15\\) mm (CCAP) under 400 N. Non-inferiority of the CCAO device compared with the SP device was proved under both loading conditions, whereas the CCAP device was non-inferior only under the load of 400 N.\n\n**Biomechanical analysis of the cadaver pelvic bone model**. All cadaver tests were conducted under a load of 300 N (Table 1B). The peak-to-peak total pelvic displacements were \\(2.62\\pm 2.18\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(2.72\\pm 1.26\\) mm (CCAP). Total displacements were \\(9.50\\pm 0.87\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(4.94\\pm 1.26\\) mm (CCAP). Plastic deformations were \\(3.05\\pm 1.85\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(3.27\\pm 1.47\\) mm (CCAP). Stiffness values were \\(191.59\\pm 62.45\\) N (CCAO) and \\(119.87\\pm 53.54\\) (CCAP). The mean symbolical displacements were \\(1.29\\pm 0.89\\) mm (CCAO) and \\(1.83\\pm 0.70\\) mm (CCAP). Non-inferiority testing was not conducted for the cadaver specimens because of the small sample size (Fig. 6).\n\n**Establishment of a trans-obturator approach using a cadaver model**. The cadavers were positioned in a supine position on a flat table, and a Foley catheter was inserted. A midline or horizontal incision (8-10 cm long) was made directly anterior to the public symphysis. During preparation through the skin and soft tissue to the public symphysis, the Serratic cord or round ligament were spared. Subsequently, the public symphysis was dissected. To expose the medial border of the obturator foramen, the pectines and external obturator muscle were partially detached. Trans-obturator access to the pelvic cavity was gained by careful digital dissection though the obturator membrane and the internal obturator muscle including the fascia. The puborectal muscle was also pierced. This procedure was performed on both sides of the pelvis to enable the fingerting to access the posterior part of the public symphysis. Visual access was limited because of the intact symphysis. The clamps of the implant were manually placed at the medial border of the obturator foramen under visual control. Intrapelvic palpation using the index finger confirmed no incarceration of the bladder. A 1.7 mm braided steel cable was passed through the guiding channels of the clamps, which were secured to the pubs by drilling and screw fixation. Using the tensioning device, the cable was tightened to compress the public symphysis. The tension and position of the cable were secured by deformation of the clamp, as recommended by the manufacturer (Cable System, Surgical Technique, DePuy Synthes). The cable was shortened and tissue layers were closed above the symphysis (Supplementary Videos 1-4).\n\nThe surgical approach for implanting the CCAP device was different from that of the CCAO device to enable the cable to be passed around the posterior side of the public symphysis (Fig. 7). We additionally performed a 3 cm cranial extension next to the public symphysis along the midline of the pyramidalis muscles. When entering the pelvic cavity via the Retzius space, the bladder could be retracted and the cable passed safely. After wound closure, all specimens were evaluated using CT, and then2 fully dissected. The following anatomical structures were at risk (Fig. 8): the artery, vein, and nerve inside the obturator canal; the sperratic cord or round ligament; the lilionginal nerve; the genitemoral nerve (genital branch); the suspensiony ligament of the penis; superficial dorsal vein of the penis; clitoral glass and body; the bladder and prostate; and the femoral artery, vein, and nerve. The full cadaver dissection showed a well-fitting implant sufficiently distanced from surrounding anatomical structures. The content of the muscular and vascular lacunae was laterally far from the operating area. The obturator nerve came closest to the implant. The lilionginal and the genitofemoral nerves had variable shapes and locations and could not be identified in all specimens. In male subjects, the sperratic cord was free from contact with the implant. In one cadaver, bladder laceration was identified (Fig. 9). Postoperative cadaver CT analysis confirmed a good implant fit to the public bone (Fig. 10). Both clamp types were located at the cranial-medial border of the obturator foramen, and there was sufficient distance to the obturator canal. There was no contact between the bladder (filled with iodine contrast agent) and the implant. Between the implant and the bladder was adipose tissue. The Foley catheter was clearly visible,\n\n\nTable 3: Statistical analysis of the synthetic bone models tested by ANOVA.\n\n and the urethra was free from contact with the implant in all cadavers. In male cadavers, there was no contact with the prostate (one specimen had prostatectomy). One female cadaver showed leakage of contrast fluid from the bladder, which was confirmed to be lacerated during the subsequent dissection. Bladder injury most likely occurred during the attempt to implant the CCAP device using a cable passer. Bone density varied between male and female subjects.\n\n## ", "4 Discussion": "\n\nWe attempted minimally invasive implantation of two medical devices for stabilization of a ruptured symphysis. Using a 3D printing technology, we fabricated solid and stable titanium implants with complex geometric structures.\n\nBiomechanical analysis of synthetic bone models demonstrated that CCAO and CCAP designs were non-inferior to the regular SP fixation when comparing important parameters such as total displacement, symphyseal displacement, and stiffness. For some other parameters, a non-inferiority test could not be conducted using the available data. Biomechanical analyses of cadavers confirmed the findings obtained using the synthetic bone models, but the results were more variable. We observed a trend for higher stability of the CCAP design compared with the CCAO design, but the difference was not statistically significant. Because we did not use a load-to-failure test, it remains to be determined whether the CCAP design has a higher ultimate strength. In our view, the combination of synthetic and cadaver bone models is essential for studying the biomechanics of symphyseal fixation devices. Synthetic bone models are readily available and highly reproducible but have limited capacity to mimic human musculoskeletal conditions[36]. Cadaver bone models are better able to mimic such musculoskeletal conditions but are usually highly variable because of differences among body donors[37]. Comparison of our results to the recent literature confirms a current pursuit of alternative fixation devices. Most recently Hinz et al. developed a flexible implant by combining plates with a fiber cord\n\nFigure 6: **Results of the cadaver biomechanical testing (\\(N=3\\)).** Parameters were similar to those obtained using the synthetic bone model. The material testing machine generated a load-displacement curve from which peak-to-peak displacement, plastic deformation, total displacement, and stiffness were measured under two different cyclic load levels. The optical system measured changes in separation of the public branches (symphyseal displacement). Sample sizes were smaller and SP fixation was not evaluated.

Bohler et al. applied suture buttons as alternative fixation in a comprehensive cadaver study and found no inferiorly compared to plating [39]. Kiskaddon et al. confirmed feasibility of suture button fixation of the pubic symphysis in their cadaver study [40]. Cavalcanti-Kussmaul et al. explored suture tape fixation of the pubic symphysis and yielded promising results in a synthetic bone model test set-up and cadaver test model [13, 41]. In contrast to the mentioned studies we decided to use a braided steel cable as tensioning device. Even so the use of modern suture material seems also reasonable. Further, the question arises whether the cable used here could be applied without the presented clamps. In a previous study we confirmed that transducer cable fixation is feasible in a synthetic bone model. Preliminary clinical cases in which the technique was applied in combination with sympsysal plating shows promising results. However, we fear loosening of the cable when used without an anchoring device because the ongoing micromotion may cause the braided cable to cut into the bone [40].\n\nIn addition to the biomechanical analyses, we demonstrated safe placement of the implants next to the pubic symphysis using a trans-obturator approach. Our anatomical study identified a safe anatomical area for implant placement and highlighted structures at risk. Immediate hazards such as bladder laceration were described in detail and precautions to avoid such collateral injury were noted. Development of orthopedic implants such as those presented here is closely linked to advancements in implant manufacturing. Implant designs and manufacturing procedures become obsolete whenever better surgical techniques or fabrication processes emerge. The current standard treatment is SP-fixation; however, implant failure is often reported as previously mentioned [42, 43, 44, 11, 47, 14]. Steel plates were originally intended to stabilize bony fractures until osseous healing could be completed; therefore, their suitability for stabilizing a dynamic, joint-like union such as the pubic symphysis is debatable. Screw detachment or loosening and plate breakage can occur when sympsysal micromotion is high, which in our experience arises especially among non-compliant, elderly, or obese patients [11]. Our CCAO or CCAO designs may therefore be advantageous because they do not rely on screw fixation. Fabrication of these implants was enabled using a modern 3D printing technology, which has greatly enhanced metal-based orthopedic prototype development. The case of 3D printing and its ability to realize complex design structures makes it ideal for implant research, especially using CMF. Ultra-fast production of a dedicated cable-clamp implant using patient-specific medical imaging data may be implemented in the future [45]. Although our implant geometries were designed based on synthetic bone models, they fitted well to the cadaver specimens so that scaling of the existing clamp sizes may also be sufficient. The synthetic binder poses no concerns for biocompatibility and stability because debinding and sintering removes all remnants; however, implant manufacture using more established techniques, such selective laser melting or electron-beam melting, is also an option because some are already FDA-approved [46].\n\nThe trans-obturator surgical approach is necessary to implant the CCAO and CCAO devices but not generally established in orthopedic surgery. Operating through the obturator foramen has been shown to be safe in other surgical specialites [47, 48]. In our anatomical study, none of the cadavers had a ruptured symphysis and all had an intact rectus abdominis. Therefore, visualization through the symphysis into the true pelvis was impaired. Supportive cranial midline incision was needed to improve visual access but might be unnecessary under real conditions in which the pubic symphysis is gapping. As previously described by Hadeed et al., some important anatomical structures must be considered [49]. In particular, the spermatic cord and ligamentum sensorarium penis in men and the round ligament, clitord body, and clitord glass in women must be spared to prevent dysperunia, erectile dysfunction, or infertility [50, 51, 52, 53]. During our dissection, we identified no conflict with the abovementioned structures. The spermatic cord was sufficiently distant, but its\n\nFig. 9: **Risk of bladder laceration during surgical procedure.** Bladder laceration might result from vigorous application of an oversized curved cable passer during trans-obturator surgery with limited visibility. **A** Bladder laceration was observed in our cadaver study, where an oversized cable passer was used to transfer the cable from one side to the other. The bladder injury was confirmed by (**B**) visual inspection during preparation, and observation of (**C**) extravasation of contrast fluid around the pubic symphysis and (**D**) entrapped air in the bladder in computed tomography (**CT**) images obtained before full anatomical dissection.\n\n position in a trauma context might differ so reduction clamps or a cable passer should be used with caution [52]. Regarding the uniferous structures, the urethra runs underneath the public symphysis. The Foley catheter could be palpated and was outside the operating area. Structures of the obturator canal are at the lateral border of the foramen and were usually several centimeters from the clamp. The trans-obturator approach may be considered an extension of previously described minimally invasive techniques such as the Fu-Liu approach [54]. To place the implant, a cable must be passed through muscles such as the pectin, addductors, obturator externus and interuns, and part of the levator an: The risk of herniation is unknown.\n\nThe following limitations of our work should be considered: We used a single-leg stance model for our study because in our experience it mimics implant loosening of the public symphysis and clinical postoperative non-weightbearing. However, some authors reasonably argue that a bilateral-leg stance model better creates distraction forces at the public symphysis and shear forces through the saccroliic joint [55, 56, 57, 58]. Furthermore, the number of our cyclic loadings may have been inadequate. Six weeks of daily walking would amount to approximately 210,000 cycles, greater than the number tested here [58]. Our pre-tests were conducted using a larger number of cyclic loads during which diminishing differences were seen, but some disadvantages of the cable-clamp device might not have been apparent. Our synthetic pelvic model had no ligaments or muscular attachments, and the load vectors would differ under real-life conditions. Nevertheless, synthetic bone models are established and well-accepted precursors to\n\nFig. 10: **Implant evaluation by computed tomography.** Top: **(A-C)** CT images of the CCAO device implanted at the public symphysis. **D**, **E** Sagittal and axial CT images of the intact bladder filled with contrast fluid. **F**, **G** Enlarged images showing the good implant fit to the bone, anterior placement of the cable, and screws fixing the clamp to the bone.

Screw and plate fixation in our study was performed without a drilling template that would otherwise improve conformity of the implantation [25, 26]. Use of the CCAO and CCAO devices is limited to public symphyseal rupture, and fracture of the public rami disqualifies any type of cable-clamp fixation. Finally, we acknowledge that analogous approaches such as trans-osseous wiring of the symphysis have previously been described [18, 19, 61, 62]. Successful biomechanical fixation has been achieved using various alternative techniques [13, 14, 15, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, option?

In some regions, the enzootic reservoir of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) may consist of domestic or wild animals1,2. Following particular environmental conditions (such as heavy rains) and/or introduction to new geographical areas, the virus can then cause large epizootics in food-producing animals, especially ruminants, and may result to numerous spill-over human cases (of all ages) infected by animals via mosquito bites, contacts with infected animals or animal products, or aerosols2,3,4,5. Estimating the burden of RVF epidemics in animals and humans is important to improve disease surveillance and control.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nFootnote 14: https://www\n\n**Statistics and reproducibility**\n\n_Model_. We developed a model to estimate RVFV attack rate and IgG seroprevalence in humans aged over 15 years old, during the course of 2018-2019 Mayotte outbreak, in two subpopulations i, determined by their place of residence (Central or Outer Communes) [29].\n\nFirst, we modelled the epidemic curve using a lognormal function \\(\\mathrm{F_{i}(t)}\\), defined as the weekly number of incident human infections (both reported and unreported to the surveillance system) in subpopulation i on week \\(t\\):\n\n\\[F_{i}(t)=\\frac{p_{1,i}}{t.\\sqrt{2.\\pi.p_{3,i}}}e^{\\frac{-\\log(\\pi t-p_{2,i})^{2 }}{2p_{3,i}}}\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(t\\) represents weekly time steps from week 2018-41 (October 2018) to week 2019-40 (October 2019). \\(\\mathrm{p_{1,i}}\\) corresponds to the total number of people infected during the outbreak in subpopulation i. \\(\\mathrm{p_{2,i}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{p_{3,i}}\\) determine the shape of the epidemic curve including its duration, its starting date (i.e. the week \\(t\\) for which \\(\\mathrm{F_{i}(t)\\geq 1}\\)) and the date of its peak (i.e. the mode of the distribution). The three parameters were estimated from the data (Table 1).\n\nSecond, I(t) was the number of infections on week \\(t\\) in subpopulation i that were detected by surveillance (reported cases). I(t) was assumed to follow a binomial distribution:\n\n\\[I_{i}(t)\\sim Bin(\\tau,F_{i}(t))\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) was estimated from the data and represents the reporting fraction, i.e. the proportion of overall human infections that were reported to the surveillance system (Table 1). \\(\\tau\\) was assumed to be constant over the course of the epidemic and similar in all subpopulations. Because both RVFV incubation time [2, 7, 8] and viremia [2, 31, 32, 33, 34] are less than a week, we considered that the week of infection was the week of symptoms onset reported in the\n\nFigure 1: **RVF data collected between week 2018-47 (November 2018) and week 2019-30 July 2019) in people aged over 15 years old.

Light blue represents data collected from people living in the Outer communes of Mayotte Island, and dark blue in the Central communes, as depicted on the map at the top-right corner (see Supplementary Note 1 for details). For reported cases (A), we represent the week of symptoms onset or, if missing, the week of RT-PCR confirmation. For the seroprevalence study (B), we represent the week of sampling. Geographical information was missing for six reported cases aged over 15 years old.**surveillance data or, when missing, the week of RT-PCR confirmation.\n\nThird, we modelled S\\({}_{i}\\)(t), the RVFV IgG seroprevalence over time:\n\n\\[S_{i}(t)=S_{0,i}+\\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^{t-D}F_{i}(w)}{N_{i}}\\] (3)\n\nwhere S\\({}_{0,i}\\) was IgG seroprevalence in subpopulation i prior to the outbreak, D was the delay between the infection of an individual and the detectability of IgG antibodies in their blood, and N\\({}_{i}\\) the subpopulation size. Here, S\\({}_{0,i}\\) and D were estimated from the data as well (Table 1).\n\nFinally, the weekly number of IgG positive samples in subpopulation i, p\\({}_{i}\\)(t), was modelled as:\n\n\\[P_{i}(t)\\sim Bin(S_{i}(t),T_{i}(t))\\] (4)\n\nwith T\\({}_{i}\\)(t) being the number of individuals sampled on week \\(t\\) in subpopulation i.\n\n_Model fitting._ The model was fitted to the case count data and serological data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, implemented with R version 4.0.3 and _rjags_ package [35]. The log-likelihoods of the \"number of reported cases\" and \"number of IgG positive samples\" components of the model for all weeks and for both geographical areas were summed together. Three chains were run for 200,000 iterations each, and every 200th value was sampled. For each chain, a burn-in of 150 samples was removed, as it was enough to allow the convergence of Markov chains. The effective sample size was at least 2340 for all parameters. Autocorrelation in the Markov chains was checked. The Gelman-Rubin statistic was below 1.2 for all parameters.\n\nEstimated parameters are summarized in Table 1. We used non informative priors for most parameters (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1). The prior of p\\({}_{2,i}\\) was set in order to search the mode of F\\({}_{1}\\) lognormal distribution (i.e. the true epidemic peak) between week 2018-50 (i.e. \\(t=10\\), December 2018) and week 2019-18 (i.e. \\(t=30\\), May 2019). This is why its prior distribution was uniform between p\\({}_{3,i}+\\log(10)\\) and p\\({}_{3,i}+\\log(30)\\). Moreover, P\\({}_{1,i}\\), the total number of people in subpopulation i infected over the course of the outbreak could not exceed N\\({}_{o}\\) the size of this subpopulation (Supplementary Table S1).\n\nWe then simulated the fitted model by computing 5000 repetitions, each of them using a different set of parameters randomly selected from the posterior chains.\n\n_Sensitivity analyses._ We performed additional independent analyses to assess the sensitivity of our results to assumptions. First, we applied the method to the whole island data without geographical stratification, instead of differentiating Central and Outer communes in the main analysis. Second, we ran the stratified analysis by considering that, in the serological data, samples were IgG positive when the OD ratio was >2.5, rather than >3 in the main analysis.\n\n**Reporting summary.** Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Cases reported to the surveillance system**. As previously described [16, 20], a RVF outbreak was declared in Mayotte with a total of 143 human cases reported between week 2018-47 (November 2018) and week 2019-30 (July 2019), including 137 who were \\(\\geq\\)15 years old. The epidemic peaked early February 2019 (on week 2019-06) with 20 reported human cases (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Geographical information was missing for 6 reported cases aged \\(\\geq\\)15 years old.\n\n**Serological data.** Mayotte seroprevalence survey was led in humans from week 2018-49 (December 2018) to week 2019-21 (May 2019) (Fig. 1). The distribution of the values of OD ratio obtained from the 2853 collected sera is displayed in Supplementary Fig. S1, suggesting that the cut-off of 3 correctly discriminated positive and negative samples. Using this cut-off, 254 out of 2854 samples were RVFV IgG positive. The positivity of samples depended on the timing of their collection, with a lower positivity around the beginning of the outbreak (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 1), hence justifying the need for a model reconstructing the temporal evolution of RVF seroprevalence and attack rate in humans. Indeed, in Central communes (resp. Outer communes), the observed IgG seroprevalence was 8.4% (19/225) (resp. 2.9% (2/69)) in the first three weeks of sampling compared to 12.2% (25/205) (resp. 8.2% (19/233)) in the last three analyzed weeks of sampling (Supplementary Data 1). Among sampling weeks included in the analysis, the maximum observed seroprevalence was 17.5% (11/63) on week 2019-14 (April 2019) in Central communes and 19.5% (8/41) on week 2019-08 (February 2019) in Outer communes.\n\n**Estimates of seroprevalence, attack rate and reporting fraction.** Our model succeeded in fitting both case count data and seroprevalence data for each subpopulation, as most of the observed data were in the model 95% prediction intervals (Fig. 3B, C, E, F).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l}\n**Parameter** & **Description** & **Unit** & **Value** \\\\ \\hline p\\({}_{1,i}\\) & Number of people over 15 years old in subpopulation i infected during the outbreak (parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution) & - & Estimated \\\\ p\\({}_{2,i}\\) & Parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution (determines the shape of the epidemic curve) & - & Estimated \\\\ p\\({}_{3,i}\\) & Parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution (determines the shape of the epidemic curve) & - & Estimated \\\\ r\\({}_{1}\\) & Reporting fraction & - & Estimated \\\\ S\\({}_{0,i}\\) & IgG seroprevalence in subpopulation i before the outbreak & - & Estimated \\\\ D\\({}_{1}\\) & Time between infection and IgG detectability & Weeks & Estimated \\\\ N\\({}_{\\text{Moyotte}}\\) & Number of people over 15 years old living in Mayotte & - & 144,2621 [FOOTNOTE:1]Footnote 1: \\(\\text{Moyotte}\\) denotes We estimated that a total of 10,797 people over 15 years old (95% Credible Interval, CrI: 4,728-16,127) were infected by RVFV in Mayotte during 2018-2019 epidemic. This represented 7.5% (3.3%-11.2%) of the total population of this age. The reporting fraction during the outbreak was estimated at 1.2% (0.67%-2.2%). Furthermore, Central and Outer communes were similarly affected overall, with 6.8% (3.2%-10.9%) and 8.1% (3.4%-12.2%) of their population over 15 years old infected, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2).\n\nThe estimated IgG seroprevalence increased from 5.5% (3.6%-7.7%) before the outbreak to 12.9% (10.4%-16.3%) thereafter, for the whole island. Split by place of residence, we estimated an increase of the estimated IgG seroprevalence from 7.2% (4.9%-9.7%) to 13.9% (11.3%-17.3%) in Central communes, and from 4.0% (1.8%-6.4%) to 12.0% (8.5%-15.5%) in Outer communes.\n\nWe also estimated a delay of 1 week (0-4 weeks) between infection and the detectability of IgG antibodies in humans (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2).\n\nWhen simulating the model using posterior estimates of parameters (Fig. 3), the peak in human infections--both reported and unreported to the surveillance system--was predicted to occur on median on week 2019-06 in Central communes and on week 2019-07 in Outer communes (February 2019 in both areas).\n\n**Sensitivity analyses.** In both sensitivity analyses, we obtained estimates similar to the baseline analysis, as detailed in Supplementary Notes 2, 3. In particular, the reporting fraction was estimated to 1.3% (0.70%-2.4%) and 1.2% (0.66%-2.2%) in the analyses using unstratified data and using a different serological cut-off, respectively.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this analysis, we fitted a model to both serological and surveillance data collected during the 2018-2019 RVF outbreak in Mayotte, which allowed us to estimate key parameters of the epidemic.\n\nWe estimated that 10,797 persons (aged over 15 years) were infected by RVFV throughout the 2018-2019 outbreak in Mayotte. This represented 7.5% of the population of this age on the island. However, only an estimated 1.2% of these infections were reported, despite the presence of a syndromic surveillance system on the island. This suggests that a large part of human cases were not diagnosed, although our study cannot determine whether the reason was because they presented no or mild symptoms, because they did not reach medical care while symptomatic, or both. Consistently with the first hypothesis, the proportion of RVFV infected humans with no or mild symptoms is generally considered to be >90%[38, 3]. In the future, including a question about recent illness in seroprevalence surveys may help to disentangle the factors of under-reporting. Furthermore, strengthening surveillance at the interface between animal and human health sectors might allow to increase the reporting fraction and to detect potential incursions of RVFV in the island as early as possible, in order to implement control measures in a cost-effective way if needed[16, 1].\n\nThe estimated IgG seroprevalence in people of Mayotte was 5.5% (95% CrI 3.6%-7.7%) just before the outbreak, as compared to the 3.5% (2.6%-4.8%) found in 2011[15]. Although we cannot rule out a small number of cryptic RVFV infections in humans may have occurred[36, 37], this result suggests that the circulation of the virus was negligible on the island between these dates. Moreover, no human RVF case was confirmed on the island between 2011 and 2018, and RVFV IgG seroprevalence in ruminants of Mayotte decreased continuously between 2011 and early 2018[38]. The small difference between the 2011 and the present studies may be due to difference in the sampled populations: contrary to our study, 5-14 years old were included in the 2011 survey and had a seroprevalence of 0.4%[15].\n\nAfter the outbreak, in 2019, RVFV IgG seroprevalence in humans was estimated at 12.9% (10.4%-16.3%). This result is consistent with a recent review which reported that, across published seroprevalence studies, 12.6% of samples collected in\n\nFig. 2: Prior (light blue) and posterior (dark blue) distributions of the model\u2019s parameters estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For each parameter, dashed vertical lines represent the posterior 95% credible interval (highest posterior density interval).\n\n humans in the year following a RVF outbreak were positive for RVFV antibodies3. Even assuming IgG antibodies confer long-term protection against infection, this proportion would not prevent a hypothetical large outbreak of RVF in people of Mayotte in the future.\n\nThe estimated pre-epidemic seroprevalence was higher in Central (7.2%) than in Outer communes (4.0%), reflecting a higher exposure to RVFV in the past for people living in this area. This may be explained by an average higher proximity of these people to infected livestock animals in the past. Indeed, direct\n\nFig. 3: **Time course of the RVF outbreak in humans.** Predicted number of weekly incident human infections, reported or unreported to the surveillance system (**A**, **D**), number of incident human infections reported to the surveillance system (**B**, **E**), and IgG seroprevalence in humans (**C**, **F**), in the population over 15 years old. **A-C** Represent Central Communes while **D\u2013F** represent Outer Commumes of Mayotte. Lines (solid and dashed) are model predictions (median and 95% prediction interval respectively, 5000 repetitions of the model). Dots are observed data (number of reported cases (**B**, **E**) and proportion of IgG seropositive tests (**C**, **F**)). Vertical bars (**C** and **F**) are 95% confidence interval for the proportion (Clopper-Pearson method). Serological data from week 2019-18 (early May 2019) onwards were not used for model fitting, because the representativeness of the sampled population was compromised (see Methods). In **C** and **F**, for visualization purposes, the \\(Y\\)-axis is cut between 40 and 80.\n\n contacts [15] and a closer spatial proximity [30] with food-producing animals have been identified as increasing the risk of infection. However, the proportion of people infected during the 2018-2019 outbreak was overall similar in both areas, probably as a result of the wide spread of RVFV among livestock populations of the whole island. Yet, the peak of human infections in Central communes was determined to occur 1 week ahead that in Outer communes, possibly reflecting the timing of the diffusion of RVFV in livestock, globally affecting Central before Outer communes [30].\n\nIn Outer communes, despite large confidence intervals, weekly seroprevalence data seemed to show a decrease starting on week 2019-08 (February 2019), which might be attributable to reducing levels of RVFV [rgb]0.999969, in people that were infected earlier in the outbreak. Nevertheless, no comparable decreasing trend was observed in Central communes, and the sensitivity analysis performed with a lower serological cut-off did not result in different model estimates. In addition, IgG antibodies are generally considered to persist for several years [31, 39], which makes their decline during the time of our study unlikely.\n\nWe estimated the period between infection by RVFV and the detectability of IgG antibodies to be 1 week, although with a wide 95% credible interval (0-4 weeks). We may have under-estimated this duration, since we considered that the week of infection was the week of symptoms onset (or, when missing, the week of RT-PCR confirmation) in reported cases. However, this under-estimation is probably \\(<\\)1 week, as much as RVFV incubation [2, 7, 8] and vireni [31, 32, 33, 34]. Furthermore, our estimation is in line with the range of values reported by Ref. [2, 7, 23, 24, 25], giving weight to our results.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, some variables such as the age, gender, place of birth or occupational contacts with livestock were not accounted for in the analysis. The reason is some of these data were not collected as part of the cases reporting (for the place of birth) or serodology survey (for the occupational contacts with livestock) datasets. Moreover, in a previous survey led in Mayotte in 2011 [15], RVFV seroprevalence was not significantly associated with the age (after 15 years old) and gender.\n\nSecond, our modelling study did not include animal data. Indeed, rather than mechanistically simulating RVFV spill-over from animals to humans as in [16], our objective was to combine two independent sources of data to assess the extent of 2018-2019 RVF outbreak in humans. Consequently, our model did not explore the mechanisms that led to a decreased number of human cases. Yet, a previous publication [16] showed the epidemic fade out very likely resulted from the depletion of susceptible animals by natural infection, thus reducing the spill-over to humans. In the future, our results will be useful to parameterize such mechanistic models.\n\nThird, we assumed that the reporting fraction was constant over time, although it might have varied throughout the course of the outbreak. However, the testing of all patients with dengue-like symptoms and negative to other infections (described above) has been implemented since 2008, and it is reasonable to suppose that the surveillance system had a steady capacity to detect RVF cases who sought medical care.\n\nFourth, we made the assumption that the IgG detection technique in serum had a sensitivity and a specificity of 1. If the sensitivity was \\(<\\)1 and the specificity was unchanged, the estimated outbreak's attack rate would be higher, and therefore the reporting fraction would be lower. On the other hand, the specificity of 1 is justified by the fact no other phleovirus is known to circulate in this geographical area, preventing serological cross-reactivity with other viruses.\n\nTo conclude, combining incidence and seroprevalence data into a model, we estimated pre- and post-outbreak seroprevalence levels and reconstructed the true attack rate. This allowed us to provide the first estimate of RVF case reporting fraction during an epidemic, a key epidemiological parameter [40] which has rarely been assessed for other important infectious diseases [41, 42, 43].\n\n### Data availability\n\nThe source data for Fig. 1 is in Supplementary Data 1.\n\n### Code availability\n\nAnalyses were performed using R version 4.2.0.

In some regions, the enzootic reservoir of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) may consist of domestic or wild animals1,2. Following particular environmental conditions (such as heavy rains) and/or introduction to new geographical areas, the virus can then cause large epizootics in food-producing animals, especially ruminants, and may result to numerous spill-over human cases (of all ages) infected by animals via mosquito bites, contacts with infected animals or animal products, or aerosols2,3,4,5. Estimating the burden of RVF epidemics in animals and humans is important to improve disease surveillance and control.\n\n[MISSING_PAGE_POST]\n\nFootnote 14: https://www\n\n**Statistics and reproducibility**\n\n_Model_. We developed a model to estimate RVFV attack rate and IgG seroprevalence in humans aged over 15 years old, during the course of 2018-2019 Mayotte outbreak, in two subpopulations i, determined by their place of residence (Central or Outer Communes) [29].\n\nFirst, we modelled the epidemic curve using a lognormal function \\(\\mathrm{F_{i}(t)}\\), defined as the weekly number of incident human infections (both reported and unreported to the surveillance system) in subpopulation i on week \\(t\\):\n\n\\[F_{i}(t)=\\frac{p_{1,i}}{t.\\sqrt{2.\\pi.p_{3,i}}}e^{\\frac{-\\log(\\pi t-p_{2,i})^{2 }}{2p_{3,i}}}\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(t\\) represents weekly time steps from week 2018-41 (October 2018) to week 2019-40 (October 2019). \\(\\mathrm{p_{1,i}}\\) corresponds to the total number of people infected during the outbreak in subpopulation i. \\(\\mathrm{p_{2,i}}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{p_{3,i}}\\) determine the shape of the epidemic curve including its duration, its starting date (i.e. the week \\(t\\) for which \\(\\mathrm{F_{i}(t)\\geq 1}\\)) and the date of its peak (i.e. the mode of the distribution). The three parameters were estimated from the data (Table 1).\n\nSecond, I(t) was the number of infections on week \\(t\\) in subpopulation i that were detected by surveillance (reported cases). I(t) was assumed to follow a binomial distribution:\n\n\\[I_{i}(t)\\sim Bin(\\tau,F_{i}(t))\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\tau\\) was estimated from the data and represents the reporting fraction, i.e. the proportion of overall human infections that were reported to the surveillance system (Table 1). \\(\\tau\\) was assumed to be constant over the course of the epidemic and similar in all subpopulations. Because both RVFV incubation time [2, 7, 8] and viremia [2, 31, 32, 33, 34] are less than a week, we considered that the week of infection was the week of symptoms onset reported in the\n\nFigure 1: **RVF data collected between week 2018-47 (November 2018) and week 2019-30 July 2019) in people aged over 15 years old.

Geographical information was missing for six reported cases aged over 15 years old.**surveillance data or, when missing, the week of RT-PCR confirmation.\n\nThird, we modelled S\\({}_{i}\\)(t), the RVFV IgG seroprevalence over time:\n\n\\[S_{i}(t)=S_{0,i}+\\frac{\\sum_{m=1}^{t-D}F_{i}(w)}{N_{i}}\\] (3)\n\nwhere S\\({}_{0,i}\\) was IgG seroprevalence in subpopulation i prior to the outbreak, D was the delay between the infection of an individual and the detectability of IgG antibodies in their blood, and N\\({}_{i}\\) the subpopulation size. Here, S\\({}_{0,i}\\) and D were estimated from the data as well (Table 1).\n\nFinally, the weekly number of IgG positive samples in subpopulation i, p\\({}_{i}\\)(t), was modelled as:\n\n\\[P_{i}(t)\\sim Bin(S_{i}(t),T_{i}(t))\\] (4)\n\nwith T\\({}_{i}\\)(t) being the number of individuals sampled on week \\(t\\) in subpopulation i.\n\n_Model fitting._ The model was fitted to the case count data and serological data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, implemented with R version 4.0.3 and _rjags_ package [35]. The log-likelihoods of the \"number of reported cases\" and \"number of IgG positive samples\" components of the model for all weeks and for both geographical areas were summed together. Three chains were run for 200,000 iterations each, and every 200th value was sampled. For each chain, a burn-in of 150 samples was removed, as it was enough to allow the convergence of Markov chains. The effective sample size was at least 2340 for all parameters. Autocorrelation in the Markov chains was checked. The Gelman-Rubin statistic was below 1.2 for all parameters.\n\nEstimated parameters are summarized in Table 1. We used non informative priors for most parameters (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1). The prior of p\\({}_{2,i}\\) was set in order to search the mode of F\\({}_{1}\\) lognormal distribution (i.e. the true epidemic peak) between week 2018-50 (i.e. \\(t=10\\), December 2018) and week 2019-18 (i.e. \\(t=30\\), May 2019). This is why its prior distribution was uniform between p\\({}_{3,i}+\\log(10)\\) and p\\({}_{3,i}+\\log(30)\\). Moreover, P\\({}_{1,i}\\), the total number of people in subpopulation i infected over the course of the outbreak could not exceed N\\({}_{o}\\) the size of this subpopulation (Supplementary Table S1).\n\nWe then simulated the fitted model by computing 5000 repetitions, each of them using a different set of parameters randomly selected from the posterior chains.\n\n_Sensitivity analyses._ We performed additional independent analyses to assess the sensitivity of our results to assumptions. First, we applied the method to the whole island data without geographical stratification, instead of differentiating Central and Outer communes in the main analysis. Second, we ran the stratified analysis by considering that, in the serological data, samples were IgG positive when the OD ratio was >2.5, rather than >3 in the main analysis.\n\n**Reporting summary.** Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Cases reported to the surveillance system**. As previously described [16, 20], a RVF outbreak was declared in Mayotte with a total of 143 human cases reported between week 2018-47 (November 2018) and week 2019-30 (July 2019), including 137 who were \\(\\geq\\)15 years old. The epidemic peaked early February 2019 (on week 2019-06) with 20 reported human cases (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). Geographical information was missing for 6 reported cases aged \\(\\geq\\)15 years old.\n\n**Serological data.** Mayotte seroprevalence survey was led in humans from week 2018-49 (December 2018) to week 2019-21 (May 2019) (Fig. 1). The distribution of the values of OD ratio obtained from the 2853 collected sera is displayed in Supplementary Fig. S1, suggesting that the cut-off of 3 correctly discriminated positive and negative samples. Using this cut-off, 254 out of 2854 samples were RVFV IgG positive. The positivity of samples depended on the timing of their collection, with a lower positivity around the beginning of the outbreak (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 1), hence justifying the need for a model reconstructing the temporal evolution of RVF seroprevalence and attack rate in humans. Indeed, in Central communes (resp. Outer communes), the observed IgG seroprevalence was 8.4% (19/225) (resp. 2.9% (2/69)) in the first three weeks of sampling compared to 12.2% (25/205) (resp. 8.2% (19/233)) in the last three analyzed weeks of sampling (Supplementary Data 1). Among sampling weeks included in the analysis, the maximum observed seroprevalence was 17.5% (11/63) on week 2019-14 (April 2019) in Central communes and 19.5% (8/41) on week 2019-08 (February 2019) in Outer communes.\n\n**Estimates of seroprevalence, attack rate and reporting fraction.** Our model succeeded in fitting both case count data and seroprevalence data for each subpopulation, as most of the observed data were in the model 95% prediction intervals (Fig. 3B, C, E, F).\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l}\n**Parameter** & **Description** & **Unit** & **Value** \\\\ \\hline p\\({}_{1,i}\\) & Number of people over 15 years old in subpopulation i infected during the outbreak (parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution) & - & Estimated \\\\ p\\({}_{2,i}\\) & Parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution (determines the shape of the epidemic curve) & - & Estimated \\\\ p\\({}_{3,i}\\) & Parameter of F\\({}_{i}\\) lognormal distribution (determines the shape of the epidemic curve) & - & Estimated \\\\ r\\({}_{1}\\) & Reporting fraction & - & Estimated \\\\ S\\({}_{0,i}\\) & IgG seroprevalence in subpopulation i before the outbreak & - & Estimated \\\\ D\\({}_{1}\\) & Time between infection and IgG detectability & Weeks & Estimated \\\\ N\\({}_{\\text{Moyotte}}\\) & Number of people over 15 years old living in Mayotte & - & 144,2621 [FOOTNOTE:1]Footnote 1: \\(\\text{Moyotte}\\) denotes We estimated that a total of 10,797 people over 15 years old (95% Credible Interval, CrI: 4,728-16,127) were infected by RVFV in Mayotte during 2018-2019 epidemic. This represented 7.5% (3.3%-11.2%) of the total population of this age. The reporting fraction during the outbreak was estimated at 1.2% (0.67%-2.2%). Furthermore, Central and Outer communes were similarly affected overall, with 6.8% (3.2%-10.9%) and 8.1% (3.4%-12.2%) of their population over 15 years old infected, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2).\n\nThe estimated IgG seroprevalence increased from 5.5% (3.6%-7.7%) before the outbreak to 12.9% (10.4%-16.3%) thereafter, for the whole island. Split by place of residence, we estimated an increase of the estimated IgG seroprevalence from 7.2% (4.9%-9.7%) to 13.9% (11.3%-17.3%) in Central communes, and from 4.0% (1.8%-6.4%) to 12.0% (8.5%-15.5%) in Outer communes.\n\nWe also estimated a delay of 1 week (0-4 weeks) between infection and the detectability of IgG antibodies in humans (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2).\n\nWhen simulating the model using posterior estimates of parameters (Fig. 3), the peak in human infections--both reported and unreported to the surveillance system--was predicted to occur on median on week 2019-06 in Central communes and on week 2019-07 in Outer communes (February 2019 in both areas).\n\n**Sensitivity analyses.** In both sensitivity analyses, we obtained estimates similar to the baseline analysis, as detailed in Supplementary Notes 2, 3. In particular, the reporting fraction was estimated to 1.3% (0.70%-2.4%) and 1.2% (0.66%-2.2%) in the analyses using unstratified data and using a different serological cut-off, respectively.\n\n## ", "Discussion": "\n\nIn this analysis, we fitted a model to both serological and surveillance data collected during the 2018-2019 RVF outbreak in Mayotte, which allowed us to estimate key parameters of the epidemic.\n\nWe estimated that 10,797 persons (aged over 15 years) were infected by RVFV throughout the 2018-2019 outbreak in Mayotte. This represented 7.5% of the population of this age on the island. However, only an estimated 1.2% of these infections were reported, despite the presence of a syndromic surveillance system on the island. This suggests that a large part of human cases were not diagnosed, although our study cannot determine whether the reason was because they presented no or mild symptoms, because they did not reach medical care while symptomatic, or both. Consistently with the first hypothesis, the proportion of RVFV infected humans with no or mild symptoms is generally considered to be >90%[38, 3]. In the future, including a question about recent illness in seroprevalence surveys may help to disentangle the factors of under-reporting. Furthermore, strengthening surveillance at the interface between animal and human health sectors might allow to increase the reporting fraction and to detect potential incursions of RVFV in the island as early as possible, in order to implement control measures in a cost-effective way if needed[16, 1].\n\nThe estimated IgG seroprevalence in people of Mayotte was 5.5% (95% CrI 3.6%-7.7%) just before the outbreak, as compared to the 3.5% (2.6%-4.8%) found in 2011[15]. Although we cannot rule out a small number of cryptic RVFV infections in humans may have occurred[36, 37], this result suggests that the circulation of the virus was negligible on the island between these dates. Moreover, no human RVF case was confirmed on the island between 2011 and 2018, and RVFV IgG seroprevalence in ruminants of Mayotte decreased continuously between 2011 and early 2018[38]. The small difference between the 2011 and the present studies may be due to difference in the sampled populations: contrary to our study, 5-14 years old were included in the 2011 survey and had a seroprevalence of 0.4%[15].\n\nAfter the outbreak, in 2019, RVFV IgG seroprevalence in humans was estimated at 12.9% (10.4%-16.3%). This result is consistent with a recent review which reported that, across published seroprevalence studies, 12.6% of samples collected in\n\nFig. 2: Prior (light blue) and posterior (dark blue) distributions of the model\u2019s parameters estimated by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. For each parameter, dashed vertical lines represent the posterior 95% credible interval (highest posterior density interval).\n\n humans in the year following a RVF outbreak were positive for RVFV antibodies3. Even assuming IgG antibodies confer long-term protection against infection, this proportion would not prevent a hypothetical large outbreak of RVF in people of Mayotte in the future.\n\nThe estimated pre-epidemic seroprevalence was higher in Central (7.2%) than in Outer communes (4.0%), reflecting a higher exposure to RVFV in the past for people living in this area. This may be explained by an average higher proximity of these people to infected livestock animals in the past. Indeed, direct\n\nFig. 3: **Time course of the RVF outbreak in humans.** Predicted number of weekly incident human infections, reported or unreported to the surveillance system (**A**, **D**), number of incident human infections reported to the surveillance system (**B**, **E**), and IgG seroprevalence in humans (**C**, **F**), in the population over 15 years old. **A-C** Represent Central Communes while **D\u2013F** represent Outer Commumes of Mayotte.

Dots are observed data (number of reported cases (**B**, **E**) and proportion of IgG seropositive tests (**C**, **F**)). Vertical bars (**C** and **F**) are 95% confidence interval for the proportion (Clopper-Pearson method). Serological data from week 2019-18 (early May 2019) onwards were not used for model fitting, because the representativeness of the sampled population was compromised (see Methods). In **C** and **F**, for visualization purposes, the \\(Y\\)-axis is cut between 40 and 80.\n\n contacts [15] and a closer spatial proximity [30] with food-producing animals have been identified as increasing the risk of infection. However, the proportion of people infected during the 2018-2019 outbreak was overall similar in both areas, probably as a result of the wide spread of RVFV among livestock populations of the whole island. Yet, the peak of human infections in Central communes was determined to occur 1 week ahead that in Outer communes, possibly reflecting the timing of the diffusion of RVFV in livestock, globally affecting Central before Outer communes [30].\n\nIn Outer communes, despite large confidence intervals, weekly seroprevalence data seemed to show a decrease starting on week 2019-08 (February 2019), which might be attributable to reducing levels of RVFV [rgb]0.999969, in people that were infected earlier in the outbreak. Nevertheless, no comparable decreasing trend was observed in Central communes, and the sensitivity analysis performed with a lower serological cut-off did not result in different model estimates. In addition, IgG antibodies are generally considered to persist for several years [31, 39], which makes their decline during the time of our study unlikely.\n\nWe estimated the period between infection by RVFV and the detectability of IgG antibodies to be 1 week, although with a wide 95% credible interval (0-4 weeks). We may have under-estimated this duration, since we considered that the week of infection was the week of symptoms onset (or, when missing, the week of RT-PCR confirmation) in reported cases. However, this under-estimation is probably \\(<\\)1 week, as much as RVFV incubation [2, 7, 8] and vireni [31, 32, 33, 34]. Furthermore, our estimation is in line with the range of values reported by Ref. [2, 7, 23, 24, 25], giving weight to our results.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, some variables such as the age, gender, place of birth or occupational contacts with livestock were not accounted for in the analysis. The reason is some of these data were not collected as part of the cases reporting (for the place of birth) or serodology survey (for the occupational contacts with livestock) datasets. Moreover, in a previous survey led in Mayotte in 2011 [15], RVFV seroprevalence was not significantly associated with the age (after 15 years old) and gender.\n\nSecond, our modelling study did not include animal data. Indeed, rather than mechanistically simulating RVFV spill-over from animals to humans as in [16], our objective was to combine two independent sources of data to assess the extent of 2018-2019 RVF outbreak in humans. Consequently, our model did not explore the mechanisms that led to a decreased number of human cases. Yet, a previous publication [16] showed the epidemic fade out very likely resulted from the depletion of susceptible animals by natural infection, thus reducing the spill-over to humans. In the future, our results will be useful to parameterize such mechanistic models.\n\nThird, we assumed that the reporting fraction was constant over time, although it might have varied throughout the course of the outbreak. However, the testing of all patients with dengue-like symptoms and negative to other infections (described above) has been implemented since 2008, and it is reasonable to suppose that the surveillance system had a steady capacity to detect RVF cases who sought medical care.\n\nFourth, we made the assumption that the IgG detection technique in serum had a sensitivity and a specificity of 1. If the sensitivity was \\(<\\)1 and the specificity was unchanged, the estimated outbreak's attack rate would be higher, and therefore the reporting fraction would be lower. On the other hand, the specificity of 1 is justified by the fact no other phleovirus is known to circulate in this geographical area, preventing serological cross-reactivity with other viruses.\n\nTo conclude, combining incidence and seroprevalence data into a model, we estimated pre- and post-outbreak seroprevalence levels and reconstructed the true attack rate. This allowed us to provide the first estimate of RVF case reporting fraction during an epidemic, a key epidemiological parameter [40] which has rarely been assessed for other important infectious diseases [41, 42, 43].\n\n### ", "Data availability": "\n\nThe source data for Fig. 1 is in Supplementary Data 1.\n\n### ", "Code availability": "\n\nAnalyses were performed using R version 4.2.0.

Introduction\n\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine became available, mass vaccination was the main pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was very effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Here, we discuss the possibility that mass vaccination might accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in antibody-binding regions compared to natural infection at the population level. Using the evidence of strong genetic variation in antibody-binding regions and taking advantage of the similarity between the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, we assume that immune selection pressure acting on these regions of the two viruses is similar. We discuss the consequences of this assumption for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in light of mathematical models developed previously for influenza. We further outline the implications of this phenomenon, if our assumptions are confirmed, for the future design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency that required massive control efforts like the 1918 influenza pandemic, the HIV pandemic, and smallpox eradication. SARS-CoV-2 variants that were substantially more transmissible or caused more severe disease than the original variant from Wuhan, China were not detected until late 2020. During this period, the public health response to COVID-19 worldwide mainly consisted of non-pharmaceutical interventions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These measures aimed to reduce the number of transmission-effective contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals in the population and, with it, viral transmission. The interventions implemented in different settings ranged from physical distancing, mask-wearing, working from home, restrictions on public gatherings, and school closures, to bans on intercontinental travel, and complete lockdowns of entire countries [2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nOne year into the pandemic, the non-pharmaceutical interventions were complemented by mass vaccination [6]. The quick development and rollout of vaccines around the world opened possibilities for relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions, and it was only with the large-scale rollout of vaccination that effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was achieved. However, the onset of vaccination campaigns nearly coincided with the detection of viral variants, dubbed \"variants of concern\" (VOCs) [7, 8], that differed from the previous variants due to their demonstrated impact on transmissibility [9, 10, 11], disease severity [12, 13, 14, 15], and the ability to evade a host's immune response [6] after natural infection or vaccination.\n\nDespite the disparities between and within countries in access and adherence to vaccines, global vaccination coverage increased at an unprecedented pace [6]. In settings with high coverage, the main goal of mass vaccination to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths was achieved. Given all the evidence, there appears to be little doubt that SARS-CoV-2 will continuecirculating as a seasonal endemic virus [17, 18, 19]. However, the seasonal pattern for SARS-CoV-2, which would be expected in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, has not settled yet and what the endemic dynamics will look like is uncertain [17, 20, 21, 22]. The expectation is that the control of the virus will be achieved by vaccination alone. At this stage, the public health authorities in many countries are faced with a pressing need to make decisions on COVID-19 management and to devise future vaccination strategies for risk groups such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and individuals with medical risk conditions.\n\nHowever, the pillar of the public health response to COVID-19, vaccination can also have implications for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in antibody-binding regions located in the spike protein that is targeted by the available vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 perpetually evolves due to its escape from the immune response in individuals induced by both natural infection and vaccination. Even in the absence of vaccination, there is selection pressure to escape natural immunity by accumulating mutations in T-cell epitopes and antibody-binding regions. Mass vaccination, as we show below, might increase this pressure and accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in spike epitopes compared to natural infection.\n\nIn this Perspective, we first review the most important factors that shaped vaccination strategies during the pandemic. We then discuss the implications of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on virus evolution in light of accumulated knowledge and in the context of the viral evolutionary theory. The current vaccines are designed to induce mostly a neutralizing antibody response against the spike protein, therefore we focus on the evolution of rapidly mutating antibody-binding regions. Finally, we give an outlook on further research that is needed to design potential future vaccines and vaccination strategies.\n\n### Vaccination strategy considerations\n\n**The importance of age**. As with other respiratory viruses such as influenza, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the distribution of COVID-19 in the population are strongly influenced by several age-dependent factors [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] (Box 1). The factors essential for devising vaccination strategies are the number of transmission-effective contacts [23, 24], susceptibility to the virus [25, 26], infectivity, and severity of infections [27, 28, 29]. Respiratory viruses are transmitted via close person-to-person contact that are known to depend strongly on age [23, 24]. In particular, children typically have the largest number of contacts in the population due to their interaction in schools [23, 24]. This has important implications for viral transmission. For example, children are believed to have played a large role in the spread of the pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 due to their generally high number of contacts and high susceptibility to the virus [30, 31]. The age-dependent contact patterns relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are similar. However, unlike influenza, the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 increases with age [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Children and adolescents younger than 20 years are estimated to be about 50% less susceptible to infection than adults who are 20 years and older, and very young children even less [26, 34]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity also increases rapidly with age [27, 28, 29, 32, 33]. Young children harbor a relatively large proportion of sub-clinical asymptomatic infections [27]. These factors, coupled with the evidence of lower infectivity of asymptomatic infections, compared to the infectivity of severe infections, resulted in children having a rather modest contribution to transmission and a very low share of severe disease in the population during the waves of the wild-type variant and of early VOG [28, 29, 32, 33]. During the waves of Delta and Omicron BA.1/2, children suffered a larger burden of infections than before but these infections still rarely resulted in severe morbidity and mortality relative to older age groups [35]. On the other side of the age spectrum, the elderly have the highest probability of clinical disease, hospitalization, and death, the last two increasing exponentially with age [28, 29, 32, 33]. This evidence factors in heavily when public health authorities have to make decisions on which groups in the population should be prioritized for vaccination.\n\n**Properties and performance of vaccines.** There are several different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulations including mRNA vaccines (with a lipid envelope and a protein subunit) and vector vaccines. The main goal of all types of vaccines is to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies mimicking the response after natural infection. Regardless of their formulation, all vaccines approved by major public health agencies were shown to have three main protection effects (reviewed in ref. [36]) that are important for devising vaccination strategies (Box 1). Firstly, vaccines offer a consistently high level of protection against clinical disease, hospitalization, and death in vaccinated individuals in both randomized clinical trials and real-world effectiveness studies. Secondly, vaccines have an indirect protective effect due to the reduced infectivity of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals relative to natural infections in unvaccinated individuals. Thirdly, vaccines demonstrate infection-blocking properties whereby they protect vaccinated individuals against any, even sub-clinical, infection. While the degree of protection depends on the vaccine brand, genetic factors, medical risk conditions, state of the immune system, the age of a vaccinated individual, and virus variant, these general protection effects are observed universally across all vaccine types and all ages. It is important to stress that, while SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offer some protection against infection, however high this protection may be, it is never perfect, i.e., the efficacy against infection is below 100%. For SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy against infection is generally lower than the efficacy against hospitalization [36]. The same holds true for influenza vaccines, for which vaccine effectiveness against infection is estimated at 30-60% [37]. In contrast, vaccine protection against infection with the yellow fever virus and most other childhood infections like measles-mumps-rubella exceeds 99% [38]. The vaccine efficacy or real-world effectiveness against the VOCs generally declined when compared with the Wuhan variant [36]. The biggest reduction was in the efficacy against infection while the efficacy against hospitalization and death were reduced much less. The decline in vaccine efficacy to decrease the number of infections was partly because the original vaccines were designed specifically for the initial virus, and, partly, due to the immune escape detailed below. At the moment, we cannot quantify which effect is larger. Bivalent mRNA vaccines adapted to target the original variant and a more recent Omicron subvariant have now been approved and deployed to a limited extent, similar to influenza vaccines that are matched to the most prevalent circulating variant.\n\n**Vacination objectives.** The public health objectives of vaccination are defined by policymakers. The choice of a vaccination strategy requires a clear definition of the outcomes that this strategy aims to achieve. In different situations and for different pathogens, some of the most desirable outcomes of vaccination may be preventing or delaying a pandemic, reducing the peak of infections or hospitalizations, minimizing the duration of a pandemic or the total number of individuals in the population that will become eventually infected before it ends. Regarding COVID-19 (Box 1), the immediate concern of policymakers was to keep the healthcare systems functioning [39]. In practice, this means that the peak of hospitalizations must not exceed the healthcare system's capacity. Another concern was reducing the total mortality due to COVID-19 [39]. The situation regarding minimizing the total number of infections differed by country. Some countries like China applied a zero COVID-19 policy that aimed to keep COVID-19 cases as close to zero as possible by imposing very strict public health measures. In other countries, including the Netherlands, the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection without hospitalization, such as long COVID and work absenteism, were recognized, but still, there was no goal to minimize the total number of infections. The vaccination objective as updated in June 2022 (Box 1) recognized the need to sustain efforts to reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission by expanding vaccination among those at greatest risk (healthcare workers, people over 60 years old, and other at-risk groups) [40]. With these public health objectives in mind, we can look through all possible vaccination strategies to determine the most desirable and practically achievable result.\n\n**Vacination strategies.** The best tools for devising control measures during the current pandemic were predictions based on robust epidemiological models calibrated to the available data [13, 32, 33, 41, 42, 43]. These mathematical models known as \"dynamic transmission models\" or \"infectious disease models\" simulate the transmission of a virus in a population and allow the evaluation of potential control measures using computers. Transmission models were used to devise vaccination strategies and served as a basis for policymaking in many countries [41, 42, 43, 43]. The model-based assessment of the vaccination impact incorporates biological characteristics of the virus, age-dependent effects in transmission and disease severity, epidemiological effects of vaccines, and additional factors that are setting-specific (e.g., the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine supply, and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence prior to vaccination rollout [29]) (Box 1). Following recommendations based on these models and considering a number of practicalities, vaccines were rolled out in a similar fashion in many countries. As a general rule, several vaccination groups (e.g., staff and residents of long-term care facilities, healthcare workers, and individuals with comorbidities) were prioritized for vaccination. After this, the vaccination rollout proceeded by eligible age cohorts, starting from the oldest and ending with the youngest [39], closely following the criteria of risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Such targeted control measures are common in epidemiology. More recently, the vaccination strategy focused on protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and individuals with medical risk conditions [40].\n\n**Global vaccination rollout**. Despite the disparities between and within countries in the access and adherence to vaccines, the global rollout has been extraordinary in terms of speed and magnitude [6]. According to recent estimates, only in a subset of 33 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programmes averted almost half a million deaths in people 60 years and older [44], and almost fifteen million deaths were prevented by vaccination in 185 countries and territories between December 8, 2020 and December 8, 2021 [45]. The desire of authorities to reduce viral transmission, protect the population from COVID-19, and speed up the return to normality, turned into a vaccination race aimed at vaccinating all eligible individuals as fast as possible. Many countries were successful in achieving high vaccination coverage, up to 90-100% in the oldest age categories [6]. It is important to note that, because vaccines were rolled out during the ongoing pandemic, the vaccination strategy had to be adapted over time in response to new VOCs and declining protection after natural infection and vaccination. Other factors that started to play a role in the assessment of vaccination strategies were the duration of immune protection after natural infection or vaccination, as well as the cross-protection from prior infection with one variant against another variant or other seasonal human coronaviruses [16]. A booster vaccination is seen as a way to increase the protection of vaccinated individuals against the new VOCs and to keep COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths at bay in those at greatest risk.\n\n### Evolutionary consequences of vaccination at the population level\n\nSimilarly to HIV, HCV, and influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is perpetually acquiring new mutations in its genome, with an average substitution rate of \\((0.7\\)-\\(1.1)\\times 10^{-3}\\)/year/site [46] (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2 evolution is especially fast in the spike protein [47, 48, 49, 50]. Three major reasons account for the rapid evolution in viral receptor proteins, such as the spike of SARS-CoV-2, hemagglutinin of influenza, and gp120 of HIV. Firstly, the spike has receptor-binding motifs that affect the transmission, and their evolution leads to an increase in virus fitness. This may play a role in the emergence of VOCs with enhanced transmissibility [9, 10, 11, 51]. Secondly, it contains epitopes, regions that are very important for the immune response because of their involvement in the binding of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Mutations in epitopes, in addition to the waning of antibodies, are a major factor that limits viral recognition by the immune system and, hence, the durability of protection against infection [47, 52, 53]. Thirdly, these epitope regions have evolved to have low physiological constraints on mutation (low mutation cost) because they serve primarily as highly-variable decoys for antibodies. Had they another important function for a virus, they would be conserved. For example, the receptor-binding site has a function and is conserved, because it hides between the protruding variable regions to prevent antibody binding. This is the case for both the influenza virus receptor (hemagglutinin) and HIV receptor (gp120) [54, 55, 56, 57].\n\nIn the next sections, we focus on the population-level evolution in neutralizing antibody epitopes related to immunity, vaccination, and viral recognition and on escape mutations that occur during transmission chains of acute infections. We postpone until the final section the discussion of the evolution outside of epitopes and of rare chronic infections, where escape mutations can accumulate within one individual.\n\nIn what follows, we assume--and this is the only essential assumption to be tested in the future experiments on which our discussion relies--that for SARS-CoV-2 the cost of mutations in antibody-neutralizing regions to virus replication ability is as small as that for influenza virus and HIV. We make this assumption because the structure of antibody-binding sites on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the structures on gp120 of HIV and hemagglutinin of influenza. It comprises several protrusions of similar lengths covered in sugars, located far from the receptor-binding site, and serving as targets for antibodies. Then, the selection pressure for these viruses to escape is reasonably expected to be of the same order of magnitude. In the general case, the final cost of mutation limits the antigenic escape [58, 59, 60], so this assumption remains to be tested in the future experimentally. Most research has, so far, focused on mutations causing the emergence of VOC, and we hope that this discussion will bring the focus to finding new epitope variants for SARS-CoV-2 as it happened for influenza and HIV.\n\nThe maximal vaccination coverage supported by public health authorities for controlling the pandemic had important consequences. In the shorter term of a few months, this approach facilitated a decrease in the number of infections, helped to unload hospitals, and to reduce COVID-19-related mortality. In the longer term, as we show in this Perspective, mass vaccination potentially further accelerates the rapid evolution of epitope regions. Let us start, however, with unvaccinated populations.\n\n### Virus evolution in epitopes in the absence of vaccination: the Red Queen effect.\n\nIn the absence of vaccination, virus evolution in epitopes at the population level is driven by the immune response in individuals recovered from natural infections whose number gradually accumulates in the population. The process is observed for other respiratory viruses, including influenza, and it has been investigated in detail in genomic, immunological, and bioinformatic studies [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]. Its evolutionary dynamics has been interpreted and predicted using mathematical models [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. The perpetual immune escape in epitopes is the reason why seasonal influenza is not becoming extinct but persists among humans. In order to avoid extinction, the influenza virus has to continue mutating to distance itself genetically from the immune response accumulating in the population. Such adaptation of an organism facing an evolving opposing species is termed \"The Red Queen effect\" (Fig. 2).\n\nThe persistent epitope evolution is observed in seasonal human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 [47, 48, 49, 50]. However, the substitution rate in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is three times faster than that of influenza's hemagglutinin, is unprecedented for an acute respiratory virus [47]. The consequences of this process become clear if we introduce two quantities describing the potential of a virus to spread in a population, the basic and effective reproduction numbers, \\(R_{0}\\) and \\(R_{e}\\) (Box 2). Both measure the Darwinian viral fitness on the population level defined as the number of individuals infected by one individual. They\n\nFig. 1: **Virial substitution rates.** Blue rectangles show the intervals of the median values for the most rapidly and most slowly evolving subtypes of HIV, HCV, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 for the full genome [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 1 incorporate several host-level factors, including the number of virions per cell, infectivity, transmission dose, the immune response in a host, and transmission bottlenecks. The former, \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\), denotes the average number of newly infected individuals caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible (naive) population. The latter, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\), denotes the average number of new infected individuals caused by one infected individual in a population where some individuals are immune. Both \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) and \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\), are defined for given public measures in place, such as lockdowns and various restrictions. They differ, by definition, only due to the immune memory accumulated in a population. Therefore, public health measures reduce \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) and \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) by the same factor.\n\n\\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) is larger than 1 for the original SARS-CoV-2 variant (range \\(1.9-6.5\\%\\)) for Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron and other VOCs [8, 9, 17, 11]. This condition means that each infected individual transmits the virus to more than one other individual which initially leads to an exponentially increasing number of infected individuals. With more and more individuals being infected and becoming immune, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) would keep decreasing until, with no other changes, transmission would become negligible.\n\nHowever, as a result of the ongoing evolutionary escape from the immune response after natural infection, as well as due to mutations outside of the epitopes including the receptor-binding domain, this outcome is altered to the stationary process with seasonal oscillations in the virus prevalence due to seasonality in transmission. At the beginning of each seasonal epidemic, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) is larger than 1. As the virus infects more people who acquire immunity, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) becomes lower than 1. When averaged over seasonal epidemics of several years, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) is close to 1. Thus, each infected individual transmits the virus, on average, to one individual keeping the number of the infected individuals averaged over a long period of time approximately constant [73, 74, 75]. This stationary process with seasonal oscillations is established after most people have already been infected at least once.\n\n**Models of virus evolution in epitopes at the population level.** Mathematical models connect the initial assumptions to predictions in the most accurate and reproducible way. A key benefit of using models is that they allow uncertainty to be quantified and to conduct scenario analyses based on a range of initial assumptions. An important observable quantity predicted by mathematical models and measured from viral genome sequence data is the speed of antigenic evolution or substitution rate, \\(V\\), defined as the rate of accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in neutralizing antibody epitopes (Box 2). Using mathematical models, \\(V\\) can be expressed in terms of several parameters, namely the number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), defined as the probability of an escape mutation per transmission in epitopes (Box 2). The latter is a composite parameter that depends on the conditions in an individual host including the virus replication error rate in a cell and the host immune response creating natural selection for immune escape mutants [76, 77, 78]. Substitution rate, \\(V\\), also depends on the virus recombination rate and the transmission advantage of an escape mutant, \\(s\\). The form of the relationship between \\(V\\) and parameters \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), \\(s\\) may vary depending on the most important factors of evolution and the values of these parameters.\n\nIn the simplest case, when the product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\) is much less than 1, immune escape mutations emerge and spread through the population one at a time (Fig. 3a). In this case, the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is proportional to \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\). This assumption is implicitly built into some epidemiological models of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 [76, 77, 78, 79].\n\nHowever, if the product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\) is much larger than 1, mathematical models predict that mutations occurring at different positions of the viral genome are concurrent in time, and the approximation of independent sweeps does not apply anymore due to strong interference between different mutations [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. This linkage interference creates several effects such as interference between emerging clones (Fisher-Muller effect) [93, 94], which is equivalent [95] to Hill-Robertson effect [96], i.e., the decrease of selection effect at one locus due to selection at another locus, as well as various genetic background effects. All of these effects are directly observed for seasonal influenza and many other viruses [93, 98, 54, 9, 37]. The linkage interference effects slow down virus evolution by orders of magnitude and change the way the substitution rate [93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99], \\(V\\), and the statistics of phylogenetic trees [99, 100] depend on the number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), and recombination rate. We refer to this situation as \"multi-locus regime.\"\n\nSARS-CoV-2 genome has hundreds of evolving sites [101]. The virus demonstrates, on average, more than two substitutions per month, or \\(1.1\\times 10^{-3}\\) substitutions per site per year [46], and modest intra-host diversity [102, 103]. Fast evolution is common for RNA viruses because they lack proofreading enzymes, their mutation rates are relatively large [104]. They all fall in the range of \\(10^{-6}\\) to \\(10^{-4}\\) per nucleotide per replication. To estimate \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), we have to multiply this mutation rate by the size of the infected population and the length of the antibody binding region. For influenza A, the mutation rate per transmission event per antibody binding region is estimated at \\(3\\times 10^{-4}\\)[73, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. For the population-level mutation rate is expected to fall within the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the multi-locus regime (\\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{\\text{p}}\\!>\\!1\\)) applies if more than \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\!=\\!10,000\\) infected individuals are present in a population, which is the case during a pandemic wave in a large city. The fact that \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{\\text{p}}\\!>\\!1\\) for influenza A H2N3, which falls into the multi-locus regime, was demonstrated using sequence data [54].\n\nThus, SARS-CoV-2 evolution can be described by multi-locus models, which have been studied intensely over the last two decades using the methods of statistical physics [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. Their exact predictions for the substitution rate, \\(V\\), vary depending on the specific evolutionary factors taken into consideration. Genetic variants arise by random mutation but are subsequently amplified\n\nFig. 2: The Red Queen effect. The effect bears the name of the Red Queen\u2019s race from the novel \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d by Lewis Carroll. As the Red Queen told Alice: \u201cNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\u201d Similarly, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in epitopes at the population level is driven by the immune response in individuals recovered from natural infection or vaccinated, whose number gradually accumulates in the population. In order to avoid extinction, the virus has to mutate perpetually to distance itself genetically from this immune response accumulating in the population. Image source: The picture is a modified version of the illustration by Sir John Tennil from Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d, 1871, downloaded from https://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/pictures/through-the-looking-glass/.\n\n or suppressed by natural selection, with random genetic drift and linkage as additional stochastic factors. However, all these models demonstrate that \\(V\\) depends weakly on both the number of currently infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{b}}\\). More specifically, \\(V\\) is linearly proportional to \\(\\text{log}N_{\\text{inf}}\\) and increases logarithmically with \\(U_{\\text{b}}\\) as well (Fig. 3b).\n\nThe multi-locus models predict that the average substitution rate, \\(V\\), is proportional to the selection pressure that describes the change of viral fitness due to mutation [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]. The selection pressure in epitopes due to immunity accumulating in an unvaccinated host population has been investigated in several modeling studies [73, 74, 75]. These models account for the immune response after natural infection, and their most important result is the general expression for the average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope created by natural immunity in recovered individuals. This quantity, analogous to the average selection coefficient in evolutionary theory, \\(s\\), is expressed in terms of only two viral parameters, one epidemiological and another immunological. The epidemiological parameter is \\(R_{0}\\), which we introduced earlier. The immunological parameter is the cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), defined as the value of the genetic distance between the infecting virus and the virus from which the individual recovered previously, at which the host susceptibility to the virus is half of its maximum value in the fully susceptible (naive) individual. The cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), is a composite parameter that combines the cross-reactivity of antibodies with their total number left after infection. The average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope has the general form [73, 74, 75]\n\n\\[s=\\frac{1}{a}f\\big{(}R_{0}\\big{)}\\] (1)\n\nwhere the function \\(f\\) grows slower than a linear function, and \\(f(1)=0\\). Equation 1 means that the average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope, \\(s\\), is lower for a larger cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), i.e., when antibodies are more broadly neutralizing (epitope binding by antibodies is less sensitive to mutations in epitope). Equation 1 also states that \\(s\\) grows with the basic reproduction number, \\(R_{0}\\). Indeed, \\(R_{0}\\) defines the viral transmission potential in the naive population and, hence, sets the scale for transmission changes with mutation.\n\nThe specific form of function \\(f\\) in Eq. 1 depends on the properties of the natural immune memory and cross-recognition, and varies among analytic multi-locus models [73, 74, 75]. While these studies differ in the description of natural immunity and, hence, in the accuracy of the predictions, they all agree on two important predictions. Firstly, these studies produce expressions for the selection pressure driving the antigenic wave in the form of Eq. 1. Secondly, corroborating earlier numerical findings [69, 70], the evolution of the virus and immune memory in a population is predicted to be a traveling wave in the genetic space that has a quasi-one-dimensional shape.\n\nCited studies [73, 74, 75] assumed that the genetic distance is linearly proportional to antigenic distance. An additional complication is that different mutations in epitopes have a variable effect on epitope binding. Some mutations make a large change in the free energy of binding, and some mutations are almost neutral. This means that the genetic distance and antigenic distance are not linearly proportional. In terms of the phenotype landscape, it has a rugged component. This fact has been investigated in detail using two-dimensional antigenic maps for influenza [61, 70] and is of major importance when short-term evolution is studied. In the long-term evolution, an effective ratio of antigenic to genetic change can be successfully described by studies with the averaged-out cross-immunity function [71, 73, 74, 75].\n\n### Effect of vaccination on viral evolution in epitopes at the population level.\n\nVaccination slows down transmission by decreasing the probability of infection of vaccinated individuals and by decreasing the viral load in such individuals should they become infected. Put simply, vaccination also makes individuals less infectious. Some studies argued that, because the virus is poorly transmitted in the vaccinated population, the reduction in the effective reproduction number by vaccination will also slow down the evolution of epitopes [78]. This prediction would be correct under the assumption that \\(R_{c}\\) was reduced below 1 very rapidly and remained at that level for a period of time long enough for the virus to be eradicated. The situation is analogous to the successful antiretroviral therapy in an HIV-infected individual. The therapy not only suppresses the number of infected cells by several orders of magnitude, but also strongly impedes within-host evolution, because it reduces the initial reproduction number below 1 very rapidly. An example at the population level is vaccination against childhood infections like measles-mumps-rubella which has a very high efficacy against infection and eradicates the virus in a population with sufficiently high vaccination coverage.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the combination of factors such as vaccine efficacy against infection below 100%, incomplete vaccination coverage, mutations in the receptor-binding region, and pre-existing epitope mutants, \\(R_{c}\\) of SARS-CoV-2 does not fall fast enough. It soon rebounds above 1 allowing for the virus evolution in a population to continue. In situations when vaccination does not have the rapid eradicating effect, it does not slow down but, on the contrary, applies additional selection pressure due to the additional immune memory cells it creates, similarly to the selection pressure from natural infection [70, 73, 74, 75]. If the cost of mutations is low enough, this immune selection pressure will further accelerate virus evolution in antibody-binding regions [58, 59, 60]. The effect is analogous to the case of suboptimal therapy in an HIV-infected individual that selects drug-resistant mutants. These mutants exist in very small quantities before therapy and become dominant in a patient within weeks of failing therapy. Highly-active drug cocktails have solved this problem. A similar dichotomy for neutralizing and non-neutralizing vaccines was predicted for the evolution of virulence [105]. Note that since we consider the dynamics at the population level, the effect discussed here will be the same both for a \"leaky\" vaccine, where all susceptible individuals have reduced susceptibility to infection after vaccination, and for an \"all or nothing\" vaccine, where a proportion of susceptible individuals are completely protected by vaccination.\n\nIn the case of the epitope evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a population, vaccination adds the immunity of vaccinated individuals to the natural immunity of recovered individuals, thus potentially favoring immune escape mutations even more. Using an equestrian analogy, vaccination spurs the Red Queen into a full gallop. Thus, the cost of the short-term decrease in the number of infections is the spread of new epitope mutations in the future. The extent to which vaccination accelerates evolution in antibody-binding regions depends on vaccination frequency, inter-dose period, molecular design of vaccines, and details of immunological and evolutionary dynamics. To avoid confusion, we emphasize that we discuss here the evolution of epitopes only\n\nFig. 3: **Schematics of the dependence of the population-level viral substitution rate on the proportion of the immune population.** Immune population consists of individuals who recovered from natural infection and who were vaccinated. Using mathematical models, population-level viral substitution rate in epitopes, \\(V\\), can be expressed in terms of the effective number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\phi}\\) defined as the probability of an escape mutation per transmission in epitopes. **a** At a low mutation rate per population per epitope per transmission, \\(N_{\\text{att}}U_{\\phi}<1\\), the supply of immune escape mutations is low. As a consequence, escape mutations spread in the population one at a time. The population-level substitution rate \\(V\\) (black line) is proportional to the immune selection pressure in a population \\(\\delta_{\\text{tot}}\\) (gray line) and the total number of infected individuals where escape mutants can emerge \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\) (red line). The dependence of \\(V\\) on the proportion of the immune population has a maximum (black line). **b** At a high mutation rate, \\(N_{\\text{att}}U_{\\phi}>1\\), many escape mutations at different positions of the viral genome spread in the population at almost the same time and compete with each other for human hosts. The substitution rate \\(V\\) (black line) is proportional to selection pressure \\(\\delta_{\\text{int}}\\) (gray line) and weakly depends on \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\) (red line), so that \\(V\\) increases monotonically with the proportion of the immune population. **a**, **b** Blue people are recovered orange, yellow, and red people are infected with viral variants with different immune escape mutations (genomes below). The evolution of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is compatible with **b** and not with **a** (see text).\n\n and not, for example, the emergence of VOC related to mutations in other regions. Before Omicron and its descendants, all VOCs had emerged before the mass rollout of vaccination as inferred from phylogenetic analyses [106, 107]. Vaccination was probably not involved as a selection pressure in their genesis.\n\nJust to illustrate the potential magnitude of the Red Queen effect, let us make a ballpark estimate. In the case of high vaccination coverage combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions, we observe a sharp short-term drop in the total number of currently infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\). The long-term impact of the decrease in the number of infected individuals on viral evolution in epitopes can be found from the substitution rate, \\(V\\). As already mentioned, all multi-locus models demonstrate that \\(V\\) depends logarithmically on both \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\) and mutation rate, \\(U_{b}\\)[108].\n\nFor example, if vaccination has decreased the number of infected individuals in a city 100-fold from 10,000 to 100, the corresponding decrease in the virus substitution rate is only two-fold. This is a drastically different result from a 100-fold reduction expected from the simpler models assuming rare immune escape mutations where the substitution rate is linearly proportional to product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{b}\\). The same consideration applies to parameter \\(U_{b}\\) which has been argued to depend on the vaccination dose in a vaccinated host [78, 79]. The effect of a change in \\(U_{b}\\) on \\(V\\) is very small (i.e., logarithmic). At the same time, the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is linearly proportional to the selection pressure, \\(s\\), created by the individuals with natural or vaccine-induced immunity [73, 74, 75], Eq. 1 (Fig. 4).\n\nThus, vaccination creates two opposing effects on the Red Queen adaptation in epitopes. One effect comes from the decrease in transmission rate due to partial immune protection and lower virus amount transmitted to another individual. This effect creates a positive selection pressure for resistant mutations. The opposite effect of vaccination comes from the decrease in the mutation rate within a host, due to lower viral load. The first effect wins, because the adaptation rate is linearly proportional to selection pressure, \\(s\\), and weakly depends on the mutation rate, \\(U_{b}\\) (Fig. 3b).\n\nSeveral studies [78, 80, 81] use standard compartmental infectious disease models and arguments following those to predict that vaccination can decrease vaccine escape by reducing the number of infectious individuals. We would like to point out that the aforementioned studies lack evolutionary dynamics because it is not built into these simplified models. For example, ref. [80] assume the vaccine escape pressure to be proportional to the number of vaccinated individuals. At best, models of this type correspond to the case when immune escape mutations emerge and spread through the population one at a time (single-site approximation or independent-locus models; Fig. 3a). As we explain above, this is the case for unrealistically-small population sizes. These models do not include proper treatment of evolutionary dynamics and disregard linkage effects existing between mutations at multiple sites, because such models are technically more difficult to handle. Here, we use the modern theory of multi-locus virus evolution that takes into account clonal interference, genetic background effect, and other linkage effects, random genetic drift, and natural selection arising due to immune memory. From the evolutionary viewpoint, multi-locus models are closer to reality than independent-locus models. At the same time, based on strong genetic variation in the antibody epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we assumed that mutations in these regions have a low cost, by analogy with mutations in hemagglutinin of influenza. The validity of these assumptions remains to be tested directly in the future.\n\n### Estimation of the vaccination effect on the substitution rate in epitopes\n\nThe modeling results obtained for natural immunity [73, 74, 75] can be generalized for immunity induced by vaccination. Due to the immune response in vaccinated individuals the total selection pressure of escape, denoted \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\), is increased by an additional term, denoted \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\), as follows\n\n\\[s_{\\text{tot}}=s+s_{\\text{vac}}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is given by Eq. 1, and \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\) corresponds to the effect of vaccination averaged over time. Because the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is linearly proportional to the selection pressure, Eq. 1, it increases linearly with the vaccination term, \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\). The selection pressure due to vaccination, \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\), depends on the type of vaccine and the epitopes it exposes to the immune system. It also depends on vaccination frequency and the period between vaccine doses which determine the average genetic distance between the vaccine vector and the currently circulating viral variant. The more recent the vaccine vector is the stronger selection pressure to escape immune response in vaccinated individuals it exerts on the virus. This relationship is determined by an important immunological parameter, termed \"cross-immunity function\" that represents the decrease in the host susceptibility with the genetic distance \\(x\\) between the infecting virus and a virus from which the individual recovered in the past [78, 73, 74, 75]. The form of the cross-immunity function determines the cross-recognition of epitope variants and may vary among epitopes, host organisms, and viruses. Reconstructing this function in each case remains a challenge but one can estimate from viral genome sequence data the cross-reactivity half-distance, i.e., the genetic distance where the host susceptibility is half of that in a naive individual. For example, for influenza A H3N2 the cross-reactivity half-distance of 15 amino acid substitutions has been inferred for humans [73] and measured for equines [109]. For SARS-CoV-2, these estimates are still to be determined.\n\nTo get an idea about the magnitude of the effect of vaccination on the substitution rate in epitopes, let us consider a simple example. We assume (i) a vector vaccine similar to Sputnik V or that generated by AstraZeneca that has the entire spike protein\n\nFig. 4: **Schematics of the dependence of the substitution rate on the proportions of vaccinated and recovered population and on the relative efficacy of vaccine compared to the natural immune response.** The substitution rate in epitopes is shown in the presence (three higher lines) and in the absence (three lower lines) of recovered individuals as the proportion of the vaccinated population increases. Red, green, and blue lines correspond to vaccine efficacy in inducing protection against infection equal, lower, and higher than the natural immune response. We assume the absence of fully susceptible (na\u00efve) individuals.\n\n with the same epitopes as the natural virus; (ii) vaccine vector is based on a virus variant similar to a variant that infected a typical individual recovered from natural infection; (iii) immunity after natural infection and vaccination are similar. Suppose that 1% of the population are na\u00efve susceptible, 9% of the population had a natural infection and recovered, and the remaining 90% of individuals were vaccinated. With these assumptions, we have 90/9 = 10-fold more individuals with vaccine-induced than natural immunity, and hence \\(s_{\\text{suc}}\\sim 10s\\). If \\(\\log N_{\\text{inf}}\\) decreases due to vaccination by the factor of 2, as we estimated above, the substitution rate, which is proportional to both \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\) and \\(\\log N_{\\text{inf}}\\), increases by the factor of \\(\\sim 1/2\\times 10\\,=\\,5\\).\n\nIf the ratio of the recovered and vaccinated was different from 1:10, the effect on the substitution rate in epitopes would differ from this estimate. The schematic of the dependence of the substitution rate in epitopes for varying proportions of vaccinated and recovered population is shown in Fig. 4. The case of some African countries which had multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly any vaccination corresponds to a small proportion of the vaccinated population (extreme case: 0%). The case of some European countries with massive vaccination efforts corresponds to a very high proportion of the vaccinated population (extreme cases 100% achieved in, e.g., the Portuguese elderly). Seasonal influenza with its annual vaccination campaigns in many countries with temperate climates would also correspond to a rather small proportion of the vaccinated population, as compared to the global mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 realized within 2 years.\n\nWe also assumed that the effects of vaccinal and natural immune response on selection pressure are the same. In fact, such symmetry is unlikely, because the number of immune memory cells against an epitope induced by vaccination and natural infection may differ. Figure 4 shows schematically how the substitution rate in epitopes changes with the relative protection (and hence, the selection pressure on epitopes) rendered by the vaccine as compared to the natural infection (compare the red line with the green and blue lines). In addition, vaccines are composed of a section of the spike protein, and the immune system generates antibodies against other viral proteins as well. Thus, the effect of vaccination on the substitution rate in an epitope can be either stronger or weaker than the effect of the natural immune response. Furthermore, the genomic regions where evolution is accelerated will also differ between vaccinal and natural responses. A detailed study based on a mathematical model and immunological data is required to calculate the acceleration of evolution in various epitopes.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, in our example, almost everyone is either recovered or vaccinated, and the overlap between the two groups is neglected. In reality, there are many people who first recovered from natural infection and then got vaccinated, and vice versa. The overlap might lead to a further increase in the speed of evolution, due to the combined effect of natural and induced immunity, however, the interaction between the two is not trivial.\n\nTo summarize, we arrived at very different conclusions regarding the effect of vaccination on the speed of antigenic evolution compared to the previous work [78, 80, 81] by exploiting the similarities in the molecular structure of antibody-binding regions of different viruses and using the modern theory of multi-locus evolution driven by the immune response. The above example illustrates that, despite the reduction of viral transmission by vaccination, viral evolution in neutralizing antibody epitopes may be accelerated by vaccination several-fold. The transient decrease in the number of infections is outweighed by a stronger immune pressure to change. The cost of the transient reduction in virus circulation is the emergence of more transmissible escape mutants and, hence, a higher number of infected individuals in the population in the future.\n\n### Future research\n\nIf SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause the substantial burden of severe disease in vulnerable individuals, we should either design a type of vaccine that does not carry any potential danger of accelerating virus evolution in epitopes but is still effective against severe disease, or find other methods of reducing virus circulation. Several research lines could be pursued further to investigate these options.\n\n### Evolution of epitopes\n\nThe vaccine design that prevents all virus evolution in antibody-binding regions is not obvious. If we use a vaccine based on old strains, with a large genetic distance to the current strain to keep selection pressure at bay, it would not protect against the virus well. If a vaccine is based on recent strains, it would protect well but it would create a strong selection pressure to change epitopes. We could gain an initial understanding of how to develop an optimal vaccination strategy using mathematical models that combine SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and evolution [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. Models of this type could predict the substitution rate in epitopes as a function of relevant vaccination parameters, and should be extended to include age-dependent transmission, vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacies against different outcomes (infection, severe disease, hospitalization, and death), and the genetic distance of the vaccine vector to the current variant. Using an age-structured model, we can find model parameters (e.g., age-specific vaccination coverages) that balance the decrease in infection incidence against the extra selection pressure due to vaccination, for various vaccination objectives. An example of the objective could be optimizing the substitution rate against the number of hospitalizations and deaths in vulnerable individuals in the long term.\n\nThe Red Queen process is observed in neutralizing antibody epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 [47] that are not functionally critical to the virus and hence can mutate without much decrease in \\(R_{0}\\) (low mutation cost). Virus evolution due to such low cost of mutations causes a rather rapid decrease in protection after infection or vaccination. This leads to the need for repeated rounds of vaccination potentially further accelerating virus evolution. However, SARS-CoV-2 is controlled also by other important immune mechanisms such as helper CD4 T-cells and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells (CTL) [110]. CTL immune response in a host lowers the viral load and hence the transmission rate at the population level. This effect is incorporated in the reproduction number, \\(R_{0}\\), which affects the selection pressure of antigenic escape, as given by Eq. 1. The waning antibody protection after vaccination may not necessarily lead to full susceptibility to severe disease because the immune system's memory for T-cells can soften the consequences of repeated infection [18].\n\nThe selection pressure at the population level for CTL epitopes to mutate is smaller than for antibody-binding regions. Indeed, their location depends on a highly-variable HLA-subtype and hence varies between individuals. Furthermore, the cost of mutation in CTL epitopes is not as low as for antibody-binding regions in receptor proteins that evolved to mutate easily. The mutation cost of T-cell epitopes is distributed broadly. It varies from very functionally important and hence \"expensive\" epitopes, where more longevity is expected, to epitopes with a low cost where the virus can mutate because the loss of recognition outweighs the cost of mutation. The mutational trajectory for CTL epitopes and their mutation cost have been studied intensely in the context of HIV infection [58, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116]. It has been predicted that CTL epitope mutations start from a cheap mutation with a large loss of recognition moving towards more expensive mutations with a larger cross-reactivity [60]. This accumulated experience may help to develop T-cell vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n\n**Evolution of fitness.** In addition to the evolution in epitopes relevant to immune protection that we have considered before, SARS-CoV-2 evolves almost everywhere in the genome producing new VOCs with increased transmissibility and changed virulence. For example, Omicron B.1 and BA.2 were more transmissible and less virulent, while there was evidence for increased virulence for Alpha and Delta VOCs [8]. In order to predict the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 properly, we need to know which positions in the viral genome are easier and which are harder to mutate. In other words, we must know the fitness landscape including the fitness effects of individual mutations, the interactions between them and, ultimately, the fitness of entire viral variants. The fitness landscape can be determined directly from viral genome sequence data using a toolbox of new methods developed within the last decade. The fitness of viral variants can be estimated by phylogenetic methods [67, 117] with the use of machine learning. The fitness effects of mutations and their interactions can be found from the short-term extrapolation of variant dynamics in time [71] or from rather popular statistical methods based on the so-called \"quasi-linkage equilibrium\" approximation that neglects genetic linkage between evolving residues [118]. The method was applied to related species for proteins of various organisms [119, 120, 121, 122, 123], and recently, to SARS-CoV-2 using different species of coronavirus [124]. A recent method developed for the multi-locus regime that does not neglect genetic linkage and hence can be applied to genome sequence data from either different species or to the same species, also permits to predict fitness effects of mutations and their interactions [125, 126]. The availability of these and related methods makes us confident that soon we will have accurate and regularly updated fitness maps of SARS-CoV-2, enabling the prediction of its potential genetic trajectories to the extent made possible by current methods.\n\n**Evolution of virulence.** Devising future vaccination strategies will require predicting the evolution of virulence. This topic remains a major concern and must be a subject of additional research. Although viruses sometimes decrease virulence to adapt to a host population like seasonal coronaviruses, this is not the general rule. Various models suggest that the evolution towards the increase of virulence does not need to be monotonous in the sense of continuing virulence decrease [127, 128, 129]. Some modeling studies demonstrate that the selection for low virulence quantified by mortality is rather weak [130, 129]. Indeed, severe outcomes or death occur late into infection, after the person has already infected most of the potential contacts and has been isolated. The general evolution of virulence is determined, primarily, as the evolution towards maximizing the reproduction number, controlled by the trade-off between two factors [127, 128]. One factor is the increase in viral fitness due to increased infectivity and transmitted dose. The other factor is the decrease in the period where infected individuals infect others, which is limited by the death or the onset of severe symptoms.\n\nThe direction of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virulence is rather complex, difficult to predict, and has been a topic of debate since the beginning of the pandemic [128, 129, 130]. More virulent variants of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved and could still arise in the future if they have higher transmissibility [130]. The Alpha variant was more virulent than the original variant [131], Delta was more virulent than Alpha, but Omicron BA.1/BA.2 was much less virulent than Delta. There are also numerous examples where evolution within a host is the cause of virulence. For example, the evolution of polio is the reason for brain damage [132], and HIV evolution is a possible reason for the onset of AIDS symptoms [133]. HIV does not decrease its virulence in time and kills almost all infected individuals if left untreated. A highly virulent variant of HIV-1 was recently found in the Netherlands [134]. It is also not clear whether SARS-CoV-2 could evolve towards higher virulence in younger age groups [127, 17]. If this possibility is ever realized, it could have major consequences for COVID-19 control.\n\n**Origin of VOCs.** Another puzzle important to solve for devising future vaccination strategies for vulnerable individuals is the origin of VOCs that have dozens of new mutations at once, with a temporary acceleration of the evolution rate [8, 135]. Alternative theories of the emergence of VOCs [19] include reverse zoonosis, evolution within immunocompromised patients with chronic infection [136, 137, 138], and evolution in subpopulations not covered by genetic surveillance. To all these diverse hypotheses, we can add the fitness valley effect, a cascade emergence of compensating mutations following a primary mutation inferred for HIV and influenza [139, 126]. Primary mutations in HIV are caused by the early immune response in CTL epitopes. Because these primary mutations decrease the ability of the virus to replicate, mutations on sites located outside of epitopes partly compensating for this decrease come under positive selection. Alleles with a stronger epistatic interaction with the primary sites sweep first [139]. About half of the epitopes do not undergo antigenic escape and are left to limit virus replication [58, 140]. The effect could be investigated using methods developed to measure interactions between mutations at different genomic locations [141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147].\n\nThe emergence of VOCs could also have to do with the effects of natural selection and recombination. The latter occurs when two or more viral variants fuse their genetic material into a new variant during a co-infection in a host. Natural selection and recombination could group and amplify a broadly variable number of beneficial mutations. A deeper insight into SARS-CoV-2 recombination [143, 144, 145, 146, 147] is therefore needed to understand its potential implications for future vaccination plans. To quantify recombination, we need to estimate the effective outcrossing number between different SARS-CoV-2 variants that is currently unknown. This number, in principle, can be inferred from genomic samples by fitting the results of simulated models. Methods previously developed to quantify recombination using genome sequence data for HIV could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as well [148]. The outcrossing number for SARS-CoV-2 could be quite large due to the possibility of co-infection during super-spreading events [149, 150, 151, 152].\n\n**Vaccine design.** From a practical viewpoint, SARS-CoV-2 as a public health problem could be solved by pursuing a better vaccine design. The protection mechanism of current vaccines is based on eliciting in vaccinated individuals the neutralizing antibody response against spike protein that imitates the response after natural infection. However, the virus evolved a specific design of spike similar to anti-receptors of HIV and influenza [153]. The receptor-binding site that serves for cell entrance is hidden from antibodies, and it has a conserved sequence. In contrast, the protruding regions of the spike exposed to antibodies are not functionally important and can easily mutate to decrease anti-body binding.\n\nThe question is then how to achieve vaccine designs that increase the cost of escape mutations. Attempts to produce synthetic vaccines from chosen sets of conserved virus epitopes prove difficult due to the protein folding of the constructs that hide the intended epitopes from antibodies. Another direction could be therapeutic antibodies or next-generation vaccines based on broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved regions of the spike protein and thus make escape more difficult [154]. The immune system mounts the T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 [155]. The development of T-cell-based vaccines is also interesting because some epitopes may be too expensive to mutate. This effect was observed before in HIV [111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116] and could be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.\n\n**Defective interfering particles and other options**. Live vaccines could be another option. Their modern formulations could be based on the concept of defective interfering particles (DIPs). DIPs are parasites of parasites, i.e., viruses that cannot exist without the main virus because they lack critically important proteins. In addition to suppressing the virus by stealing its proteins [156, 157, 158, 159], a DIP can also serve as a live vaccine eliciting an immune response [160]. Prototypes of DIPs demonstrating both in-host viral suppression and vaccination properties have been recently developed for SARS-CoV-2 [156, 160]. Importantly, a DIP is under pressure to co-evolve with the main virus and may be actually co-stable [157, 158]. Next-generation medicines such as oral antiviral agents and monoclonal antibody prophylaxis will also be needed, especially for immunocompromised people for whom vaccination is not effective.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMass vaccination has been very effective in reducing deaths, severe disease, and overall disease burden due to COVID-19 in many countries. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to escape to some extent from both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. From this Perspective, we discussed the possibility that global vaccination may accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in rapidly mutating antibody-binding regions compared to natural infection. Our conclusions rely on the assumption that immune selection pressure acting on the antibody-binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, and on existing multi-locus models of influenza evolution. To this end, we took advantage of the similarity between the envelope proteins of the two viruses and the evidence of strong genetic variation in the antibody epitopes. The validity of our assumption remains to be tested directly for SARS-CoV-2 in the future, as it was done for the influenza virus. The potential impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 evolution should be acknowledged for future vaccination strategies that target most at-risk populations, especially if vaccination campaigns will cover a substantial part of the population. Mutations in immunologically-relevant genomic regions, viral recombination, virulence, and fitness evolution must be considered when designing a future vaccination strategy. Finally, we would like to stress that despite the potential implications of vaccination for evolution in the antibody epitopes, in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis like the one we just experienced, mass vaccination is probably the only tool to prevent widespread loss of human lives and huge economic costs.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Perra, N.

Introduction": "\n\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine became available, mass vaccination was the main pillar of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was very effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Here, we discuss the possibility that mass vaccination might accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in antibody-binding regions compared to natural infection at the population level. Using the evidence of strong genetic variation in antibody-binding regions and taking advantage of the similarity between the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, we assume that immune selection pressure acting on these regions of the two viruses is similar. We discuss the consequences of this assumption for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in light of mathematical models developed previously for influenza. We further outline the implications of this phenomenon, if our assumptions are confirmed, for the future design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency that required massive control efforts like the 1918 influenza pandemic, the HIV pandemic, and smallpox eradication. SARS-CoV-2 variants that were substantially more transmissible or caused more severe disease than the original variant from Wuhan, China were not detected until late 2020. During this period, the public health response to COVID-19 worldwide mainly consisted of non-pharmaceutical interventions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. These measures aimed to reduce the number of transmission-effective contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals in the population and, with it, viral transmission. The interventions implemented in different settings ranged from physical distancing, mask-wearing, working from home, restrictions on public gatherings, and school closures, to bans on intercontinental travel, and complete lockdowns of entire countries [2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nOne year into the pandemic, the non-pharmaceutical interventions were complemented by mass vaccination [6]. The quick development and rollout of vaccines around the world opened possibilities for relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions, and it was only with the large-scale rollout of vaccination that effective control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was achieved. However, the onset of vaccination campaigns nearly coincided with the detection of viral variants, dubbed \"variants of concern\" (VOCs) [7, 8], that differed from the previous variants due to their demonstrated impact on transmissibility [9, 10, 11], disease severity [12, 13, 14, 15], and the ability to evade a host's immune response [6] after natural infection or vaccination.\n\nDespite the disparities between and within countries in access and adherence to vaccines, global vaccination coverage increased at an unprecedented pace [6]. In settings with high coverage, the main goal of mass vaccination to reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths was achieved. Given all the evidence, there appears to be little doubt that SARS-CoV-2 will continuecirculating as a seasonal endemic virus [17, 18, 19]. However, the seasonal pattern for SARS-CoV-2, which would be expected in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, has not settled yet and what the endemic dynamics will look like is uncertain [17, 20, 21, 22]. The expectation is that the control of the virus will be achieved by vaccination alone. At this stage, the public health authorities in many countries are faced with a pressing need to make decisions on COVID-19 management and to devise future vaccination strategies for risk groups such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and individuals with medical risk conditions.\n\nHowever, the pillar of the public health response to COVID-19, vaccination can also have implications for SARS-CoV-2 evolution in antibody-binding regions located in the spike protein that is targeted by the available vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 perpetually evolves due to its escape from the immune response in individuals induced by both natural infection and vaccination. Even in the absence of vaccination, there is selection pressure to escape natural immunity by accumulating mutations in T-cell epitopes and antibody-binding regions. Mass vaccination, as we show below, might increase this pressure and accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in spike epitopes compared to natural infection.\n\nIn this Perspective, we first review the most important factors that shaped vaccination strategies during the pandemic. We then discuss the implications of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on virus evolution in light of accumulated knowledge and in the context of the viral evolutionary theory. The current vaccines are designed to induce mostly a neutralizing antibody response against the spike protein, therefore we focus on the evolution of rapidly mutating antibody-binding regions. Finally, we give an outlook on further research that is needed to design potential future vaccines and vaccination strategies.\n\n### ", "Vaccination strategy considerations": "\n\n**The importance of age**. As with other respiratory viruses such as influenza, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the distribution of COVID-19 in the population are strongly influenced by several age-dependent factors [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] (Box 1). The factors essential for devising vaccination strategies are the number of transmission-effective contacts [23, 24], susceptibility to the virus [25, 26], infectivity, and severity of infections [27, 28, 29]. Respiratory viruses are transmitted via close person-to-person contact that are known to depend strongly on age [23, 24]. In particular, children typically have the largest number of contacts in the population due to their interaction in schools [23, 24]. This has important implications for viral transmission. For example, children are believed to have played a large role in the spread of the pandemic influenza A H1N1 in 2009 due to their generally high number of contacts and high susceptibility to the virus [30, 31]. The age-dependent contact patterns relevant to SARS-CoV-2 transmission are similar. However, unlike influenza, the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 increases with age [25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. Children and adolescents younger than 20 years are estimated to be about 50% less susceptible to infection than adults who are 20 years and older, and very young children even less [26, 34]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity also increases rapidly with age [27, 28, 29, 32, 33]. Young children harbor a relatively large proportion of sub-clinical asymptomatic infections [27]. These factors, coupled with the evidence of lower infectivity of asymptomatic infections, compared to the infectivity of severe infections, resulted in children having a rather modest contribution to transmission and a very low share of severe disease in the population during the waves of the wild-type variant and of early VOG [28, 29, 32, 33]. During the waves of Delta and Omicron BA.1/2, children suffered a larger burden of infections than before but these infections still rarely resulted in severe morbidity and mortality relative to older age groups [35]. On the other side of the age spectrum, the elderly have the highest probability of clinical disease, hospitalization, and death, the last two increasing exponentially with age [28, 29, 32, 33]. This evidence factors in heavily when public health authorities have to make decisions on which groups in the population should be prioritized for vaccination.\n\n**Properties and performance of vaccines.** There are several different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulations including mRNA vaccines (with a lipid envelope and a protein subunit) and vector vaccines. The main goal of all types of vaccines is to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies mimicking the response after natural infection. Regardless of their formulation, all vaccines approved by major public health agencies were shown to have three main protection effects (reviewed in ref. [36]) that are important for devising vaccination strategies (Box 1). Firstly, vaccines offer a consistently high level of protection against clinical disease, hospitalization, and death in vaccinated individuals in both randomized clinical trials and real-world effectiveness studies. Secondly, vaccines have an indirect protective effect due to the reduced infectivity of breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals relative to natural infections in unvaccinated individuals. Thirdly, vaccines demonstrate infection-blocking properties whereby they protect vaccinated individuals against any, even sub-clinical, infection. While the degree of protection depends on the vaccine brand, genetic factors, medical risk conditions, state of the immune system, the age of a vaccinated individual, and virus variant, these general protection effects are observed universally across all vaccine types and all ages. It is important to stress that, while SARS-CoV-2 vaccines offer some protection against infection, however high this protection may be, it is never perfect, i.e., the efficacy against infection is below 100%. For SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy against infection is generally lower than the efficacy against hospitalization [36]. The same holds true for influenza vaccines, for which vaccine effectiveness against infection is estimated at 30-60% [37]. In contrast, vaccine protection against infection with the yellow fever virus and most other childhood infections like measles-mumps-rubella exceeds 99% [38]. The vaccine efficacy or real-world effectiveness against the VOCs generally declined when compared with the Wuhan variant [36]. The biggest reduction was in the efficacy against infection while the efficacy against hospitalization and death were reduced much less. The decline in vaccine efficacy to decrease the number of infections was partly because the original vaccines were designed specifically for the initial virus, and, partly, due to the immune escape detailed below. At the moment, we cannot quantify which effect is larger. Bivalent mRNA vaccines adapted to target the original variant and a more recent Omicron subvariant have now been approved and deployed to a limited extent, similar to influenza vaccines that are matched to the most prevalent circulating variant.\n\n**Vacination objectives.** The public health objectives of vaccination are defined by policymakers. The choice of a vaccination strategy requires a clear definition of the outcomes that this strategy aims to achieve. In different situations and for different pathogens, some of the most desirable outcomes of vaccination may be preventing or delaying a pandemic, reducing the peak of infections or hospitalizations, minimizing the duration of a pandemic or the total number of individuals in the population that will become eventually infected before it ends. Regarding COVID-19 (Box 1), the immediate concern of policymakers was to keep the healthcare systems functioning [39]. In practice, this means that the peak of hospitalizations must not exceed the healthcare system's capacity. Another concern was reducing the total mortality due to COVID-19 [39]. The situation regarding minimizing the total number of infections differed by country. Some countries like China applied a zero COVID-19 policy that aimed to keep COVID-19 cases as close to zero as possible by imposing very strict public health measures. In other countries, including the Netherlands, the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection without hospitalization, such as long COVID and work absenteism, were recognized, but still, there was no goal to minimize the total number of infections. The vaccination objective as updated in June 2022 (Box 1) recognized the need to sustain efforts to reduce mortality, morbidity, and transmission by expanding vaccination among those at greatest risk (healthcare workers, people over 60 years old, and other at-risk groups) [40]. With these public health objectives in mind, we can look through all possible vaccination strategies to determine the most desirable and practically achievable result.\n\n**Vacination strategies.** The best tools for devising control measures during the current pandemic were predictions based on robust epidemiological models calibrated to the available data [13, 32, 33, 41, 42, 43]. These mathematical models known as \"dynamic transmission models\" or \"infectious disease models\" simulate the transmission of a virus in a population and allow the evaluation of potential control measures using computers. Transmission models were used to devise vaccination strategies and served as a basis for policymaking in many countries [41, 42, 43, 43]. The model-based assessment of the vaccination impact incorporates biological characteristics of the virus, age-dependent effects in transmission and disease severity, epidemiological effects of vaccines, and additional factors that are setting-specific (e.g., the level of non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine supply, and SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence prior to vaccination rollout [29]) (Box 1). Following recommendations based on these models and considering a number of practicalities, vaccines were rolled out in a similar fashion in many countries. As a general rule, several vaccination groups (e.g., staff and residents of long-term care facilities, healthcare workers, and individuals with comorbidities) were prioritized for vaccination. After this, the vaccination rollout proceeded by eligible age cohorts, starting from the oldest and ending with the youngest [39], closely following the criteria of risk for COVID-19 hospitalization and death. Such targeted control measures are common in epidemiology. More recently, the vaccination strategy focused on protecting vulnerable groups such as the elderly, healthcare workers, and individuals with medical risk conditions [40].\n\n**Global vaccination rollout**. Despite the disparities between and within countries in the access and adherence to vaccines, the global rollout has been extraordinary in terms of speed and magnitude [6]. According to recent estimates, only in a subset of 33 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region the widespread implementation of COVID-19 vaccination programmes averted almost half a million deaths in people 60 years and older [44], and almost fifteen million deaths were prevented by vaccination in 185 countries and territories between December 8, 2020 and December 8, 2021 [45]. The desire of authorities to reduce viral transmission, protect the population from COVID-19, and speed up the return to normality, turned into a vaccination race aimed at vaccinating all eligible individuals as fast as possible. Many countries were successful in achieving high vaccination coverage, up to 90-100% in the oldest age categories [6]. It is important to note that, because vaccines were rolled out during the ongoing pandemic, the vaccination strategy had to be adapted over time in response to new VOCs and declining protection after natural infection and vaccination. Other factors that started to play a role in the assessment of vaccination strategies were the duration of immune protection after natural infection or vaccination, as well as the cross-protection from prior infection with one variant against another variant or other seasonal human coronaviruses [16]. A booster vaccination is seen as a way to increase the protection of vaccinated individuals against the new VOCs and to keep COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths at bay in those at greatest risk.\n\n### ", "Evolutionary consequences of vaccination at the population level": "\n\nSimilarly to HIV, HCV, and influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 is perpetually acquiring new mutations in its genome, with an average substitution rate of \\((0.7\\)-\\(1.1)\\times 10^{-3}\\)/year/site [46] (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2 evolution is especially fast in the spike protein [47, 48, 49, 50]. Three major reasons account for the rapid evolution in viral receptor proteins, such as the spike of SARS-CoV-2, hemagglutinin of influenza, and gp120 of HIV. Firstly, the spike has receptor-binding motifs that affect the transmission, and their evolution leads to an increase in virus fitness. This may play a role in the emergence of VOCs with enhanced transmissibility [9, 10, 11, 51]. Secondly, it contains epitopes, regions that are very important for the immune response because of their involvement in the binding of antibodies that can neutralize the virus. Mutations in epitopes, in addition to the waning of antibodies, are a major factor that limits viral recognition by the immune system and, hence, the durability of protection against infection [47, 52, 53]. Thirdly, these epitope regions have evolved to have low physiological constraints on mutation (low mutation cost) because they serve primarily as highly-variable decoys for antibodies. Had they another important function for a virus, they would be conserved. For example, the receptor-binding site has a function and is conserved, because it hides between the protruding variable regions to prevent antibody binding. This is the case for both the influenza virus receptor (hemagglutinin) and HIV receptor (gp120) [54, 55, 56, 57].\n\nIn the next sections, we focus on the population-level evolution in neutralizing antibody epitopes related to immunity, vaccination, and viral recognition and on escape mutations that occur during transmission chains of acute infections. We postpone until the final section the discussion of the evolution outside of epitopes and of rare chronic infections, where escape mutations can accumulate within one individual.\n\nIn what follows, we assume--and this is the only essential assumption to be tested in the future experiments on which our discussion relies--that for SARS-CoV-2 the cost of mutations in antibody-neutralizing regions to virus replication ability is as small as that for influenza virus and HIV. We make this assumption because the structure of antibody-binding sites on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the structures on gp120 of HIV and hemagglutinin of influenza. It comprises several protrusions of similar lengths covered in sugars, located far from the receptor-binding site, and serving as targets for antibodies. Then, the selection pressure for these viruses to escape is reasonably expected to be of the same order of magnitude. In the general case, the final cost of mutation limits the antigenic escape [58, 59, 60], so this assumption remains to be tested in the future experimentally. Most research has, so far, focused on mutations causing the emergence of VOC, and we hope that this discussion will bring the focus to finding new epitope variants for SARS-CoV-2 as it happened for influenza and HIV.\n\nThe maximal vaccination coverage supported by public health authorities for controlling the pandemic had important consequences. In the shorter term of a few months, this approach facilitated a decrease in the number of infections, helped to unload hospitals, and to reduce COVID-19-related mortality. In the longer term, as we show in this Perspective, mass vaccination potentially further accelerates the rapid evolution of epitope regions. Let us start, however, with unvaccinated populations.\n\n### ", "Virus evolution in epitopes in the absence of vaccination: the Red Queen effect.": "\n\nIn the absence of vaccination, virus evolution in epitopes at the population level is driven by the immune response in individuals recovered from natural infections whose number gradually accumulates in the population. The process is observed for other respiratory viruses, including influenza, and it has been investigated in detail in genomic, immunological, and bioinformatic studies [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]. Its evolutionary dynamics has been interpreted and predicted using mathematical models [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. The perpetual immune escape in epitopes is the reason why seasonal influenza is not becoming extinct but persists among humans. In order to avoid extinction, the influenza virus has to continue mutating to distance itself genetically from the immune response accumulating in the population. Such adaptation of an organism facing an evolving opposing species is termed \"The Red Queen effect\" (Fig. 2).\n\nThe persistent epitope evolution is observed in seasonal human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 [47, 48, 49, 50]. However, the substitution rate in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is three times faster than that of influenza's hemagglutinin, is unprecedented for an acute respiratory virus [47]. The consequences of this process become clear if we introduce two quantities describing the potential of a virus to spread in a population, the basic and effective reproduction numbers, \\(R_{0}\\) and \\(R_{e}\\) (Box 2). Both measure the Darwinian viral fitness on the population level defined as the number of individuals infected by one individual. They\n\nFig. 1: **Virial substitution rates.** Blue rectangles show the intervals of the median values for the most rapidly and most slowly evolving subtypes of HIV, HCV, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2 for the full genome [66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 1 incorporate several host-level factors, including the number of virions per cell, infectivity, transmission dose, the immune response in a host, and transmission bottlenecks. The former, \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\), denotes the average number of newly infected individuals caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible (naive) population. The latter, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\), denotes the average number of new infected individuals caused by one infected individual in a population where some individuals are immune. Both \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) and \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\), are defined for given public measures in place, such as lockdowns and various restrictions. They differ, by definition, only due to the immune memory accumulated in a population. Therefore, public health measures reduce \\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) and \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) by the same factor.\n\n\\(R_{\\text{0}}\\) is larger than 1 for the original SARS-CoV-2 variant (range \\(1.9-6.5\\%\\)) for Alpha, Delta, Gamma, Omicron and other VOCs [8, 9, 17, 11]. This condition means that each infected individual transmits the virus to more than one other individual which initially leads to an exponentially increasing number of infected individuals. With more and more individuals being infected and becoming immune, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) would keep decreasing until, with no other changes, transmission would become negligible.\n\nHowever, as a result of the ongoing evolutionary escape from the immune response after natural infection, as well as due to mutations outside of the epitopes including the receptor-binding domain, this outcome is altered to the stationary process with seasonal oscillations in the virus prevalence due to seasonality in transmission. At the beginning of each seasonal epidemic, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) is larger than 1. As the virus infects more people who acquire immunity, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) becomes lower than 1. When averaged over seasonal epidemics of several years, \\(R_{\\text{o}}\\) is close to 1. Thus, each infected individual transmits the virus, on average, to one individual keeping the number of the infected individuals averaged over a long period of time approximately constant [73, 74, 75]. This stationary process with seasonal oscillations is established after most people have already been infected at least once.\n\n**Models of virus evolution in epitopes at the population level.** Mathematical models connect the initial assumptions to predictions in the most accurate and reproducible way. A key benefit of using models is that they allow uncertainty to be quantified and to conduct scenario analyses based on a range of initial assumptions. An important observable quantity predicted by mathematical models and measured from viral genome sequence data is the speed of antigenic evolution or substitution rate, \\(V\\), defined as the rate of accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in neutralizing antibody epitopes (Box 2). Using mathematical models, \\(V\\) can be expressed in terms of several parameters, namely the number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), defined as the probability of an escape mutation per transmission in epitopes (Box 2). The latter is a composite parameter that depends on the conditions in an individual host including the virus replication error rate in a cell and the host immune response creating natural selection for immune escape mutants [76, 77, 78]. Substitution rate, \\(V\\), also depends on the virus recombination rate and the transmission advantage of an escape mutant, \\(s\\). The form of the relationship between \\(V\\) and parameters \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), \\(s\\) may vary depending on the most important factors of evolution and the values of these parameters.\n\nIn the simplest case, when the product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\) is much less than 1, immune escape mutations emerge and spread through the population one at a time (Fig. 3a). In this case, the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is proportional to \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\). This assumption is implicitly built into some epidemiological models of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 [76, 77, 78, 79].\n\nHowever, if the product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}U_{\\text{p}}\\) is much larger than 1, mathematical models predict that mutations occurring at different positions of the viral genome are concurrent in time, and the approximation of independent sweeps does not apply anymore due to strong interference between different mutations [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. This linkage interference creates several effects such as interference between emerging clones (Fisher-Muller effect) [93, 94], which is equivalent [95] to Hill-Robertson effect [96], i.e., the decrease of selection effect at one locus due to selection at another locus, as well as various genetic background effects. All of these effects are directly observed for seasonal influenza and many other viruses [93, 98, 54, 9, 37]. The linkage interference effects slow down virus evolution by orders of magnitude and change the way the substitution rate [93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99], \\(V\\), and the statistics of phylogenetic trees [99, 100] depend on the number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), and recombination rate. We refer to this situation as \"multi-locus regime.\"\n\nSARS-CoV-2 genome has hundreds of evolving sites [101]. The virus demonstrates, on average, more than two substitutions per month, or \\(1.1\\times 10^{-3}\\) substitutions per site per year [46], and modest intra-host diversity [102, 103]. Fast evolution is common for RNA viruses because they lack proofreading enzymes, their mutation rates are relatively large [104]. They all fall in the range of \\(10^{-6}\\) to \\(10^{-4}\\) per nucleotide per replication. To estimate \\(U_{\\text{p}}\\), we have to multiply this mutation rate by the size of the infected population and the length of the antibody binding region. For influenza A, the mutation rate per transmission event per antibody binding region is estimated at \\(3\\times 10^{-4}\\)[73, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. For the population-level mutation rate is expected to fall within the same order of magnitude. Therefore, the multi-locus regime (\\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{\\text{p}}\\!>\\!1\\)) applies if more than \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\!=\\!10,000\\) infected individuals are present in a population, which is the case during a pandemic wave in a large city. The fact that \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{\\text{p}}\\!>\\!1\\) for influenza A H2N3, which falls into the multi-locus regime, was demonstrated using sequence data [54].\n\nThus, SARS-CoV-2 evolution can be described by multi-locus models, which have been studied intensely over the last two decades using the methods of statistical physics [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]. Their exact predictions for the substitution rate, \\(V\\), vary depending on the specific evolutionary factors taken into consideration. Genetic variants arise by random mutation but are subsequently amplified\n\nFig. 2: The Red Queen effect. The effect bears the name of the Red Queen\u2019s race from the novel \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d by Lewis Carroll. As the Red Queen told Alice: \u201cNow, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\u201d Similarly, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in epitopes at the population level is driven by the immune response in individuals recovered from natural infection or vaccinated, whose number gradually accumulates in the population. In order to avoid extinction, the virus has to mutate perpetually to distance itself genetically from this immune response accumulating in the population. Image source: The picture is a modified version of the illustration by Sir John Tennil from Lewis Carroll\u2019s \u201cThrough the Looking-Glass\u201d, 1871, downloaded from https://www.alice-in-wonderland.net/resources/pictures/through-the-looking-glass/.\n\n or suppressed by natural selection, with random genetic drift and linkage as additional stochastic factors. However, all these models demonstrate that \\(V\\) depends weakly on both the number of currently infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\text{b}}\\). More specifically, \\(V\\) is linearly proportional to \\(\\text{log}N_{\\text{inf}}\\) and increases logarithmically with \\(U_{\\text{b}}\\) as well (Fig. 3b).\n\nThe multi-locus models predict that the average substitution rate, \\(V\\), is proportional to the selection pressure that describes the change of viral fitness due to mutation [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89]. The selection pressure in epitopes due to immunity accumulating in an unvaccinated host population has been investigated in several modeling studies [73, 74, 75]. These models account for the immune response after natural infection, and their most important result is the general expression for the average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope created by natural immunity in recovered individuals. This quantity, analogous to the average selection coefficient in evolutionary theory, \\(s\\), is expressed in terms of only two viral parameters, one epidemiological and another immunological. The epidemiological parameter is \\(R_{0}\\), which we introduced earlier. The immunological parameter is the cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), defined as the value of the genetic distance between the infecting virus and the virus from which the individual recovered previously, at which the host susceptibility to the virus is half of its maximum value in the fully susceptible (naive) individual. The cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), is a composite parameter that combines the cross-reactivity of antibodies with their total number left after infection. The average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope has the general form [73, 74, 75]\n\n\\[s=\\frac{1}{a}f\\big{(}R_{0}\\big{)}\\] (1)\n\nwhere the function \\(f\\) grows slower than a linear function, and \\(f(1)=0\\). Equation 1 means that the average transmission advantage of an escape mutation in an epitope, \\(s\\), is lower for a larger cross-immunity distance, \\(a\\), i.e., when antibodies are more broadly neutralizing (epitope binding by antibodies is less sensitive to mutations in epitope). Equation 1 also states that \\(s\\) grows with the basic reproduction number, \\(R_{0}\\). Indeed, \\(R_{0}\\) defines the viral transmission potential in the naive population and, hence, sets the scale for transmission changes with mutation.\n\nThe specific form of function \\(f\\) in Eq. 1 depends on the properties of the natural immune memory and cross-recognition, and varies among analytic multi-locus models [73, 74, 75]. While these studies differ in the description of natural immunity and, hence, in the accuracy of the predictions, they all agree on two important predictions. Firstly, these studies produce expressions for the selection pressure driving the antigenic wave in the form of Eq. 1. Secondly, corroborating earlier numerical findings [69, 70], the evolution of the virus and immune memory in a population is predicted to be a traveling wave in the genetic space that has a quasi-one-dimensional shape.\n\nCited studies [73, 74, 75] assumed that the genetic distance is linearly proportional to antigenic distance. An additional complication is that different mutations in epitopes have a variable effect on epitope binding. Some mutations make a large change in the free energy of binding, and some mutations are almost neutral. This means that the genetic distance and antigenic distance are not linearly proportional. In terms of the phenotype landscape, it has a rugged component. This fact has been investigated in detail using two-dimensional antigenic maps for influenza [61, 70] and is of major importance when short-term evolution is studied. In the long-term evolution, an effective ratio of antigenic to genetic change can be successfully described by studies with the averaged-out cross-immunity function [71, 73, 74, 75].\n\n### ", "Effect of vaccination on viral evolution in epitopes at the population level.": "\n\nVaccination slows down transmission by decreasing the probability of infection of vaccinated individuals and by decreasing the viral load in such individuals should they become infected. Put simply, vaccination also makes individuals less infectious. Some studies argued that, because the virus is poorly transmitted in the vaccinated population, the reduction in the effective reproduction number by vaccination will also slow down the evolution of epitopes [78]. This prediction would be correct under the assumption that \\(R_{c}\\) was reduced below 1 very rapidly and remained at that level for a period of time long enough for the virus to be eradicated. The situation is analogous to the successful antiretroviral therapy in an HIV-infected individual. The therapy not only suppresses the number of infected cells by several orders of magnitude, but also strongly impedes within-host evolution, because it reduces the initial reproduction number below 1 very rapidly. An example at the population level is vaccination against childhood infections like measles-mumps-rubella which has a very high efficacy against infection and eradicates the virus in a population with sufficiently high vaccination coverage.\n\nUnfortunately, due to the combination of factors such as vaccine efficacy against infection below 100%, incomplete vaccination coverage, mutations in the receptor-binding region, and pre-existing epitope mutants, \\(R_{c}\\) of SARS-CoV-2 does not fall fast enough. It soon rebounds above 1 allowing for the virus evolution in a population to continue. In situations when vaccination does not have the rapid eradicating effect, it does not slow down but, on the contrary, applies additional selection pressure due to the additional immune memory cells it creates, similarly to the selection pressure from natural infection [70, 73, 74, 75]. If the cost of mutations is low enough, this immune selection pressure will further accelerate virus evolution in antibody-binding regions [58, 59, 60]. The effect is analogous to the case of suboptimal therapy in an HIV-infected individual that selects drug-resistant mutants. These mutants exist in very small quantities before therapy and become dominant in a patient within weeks of failing therapy. Highly-active drug cocktails have solved this problem. A similar dichotomy for neutralizing and non-neutralizing vaccines was predicted for the evolution of virulence [105]. Note that since we consider the dynamics at the population level, the effect discussed here will be the same both for a \"leaky\" vaccine, where all susceptible individuals have reduced susceptibility to infection after vaccination, and for an \"all or nothing\" vaccine, where a proportion of susceptible individuals are completely protected by vaccination.\n\nIn the case of the epitope evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a population, vaccination adds the immunity of vaccinated individuals to the natural immunity of recovered individuals, thus potentially favoring immune escape mutations even more. Using an equestrian analogy, vaccination spurs the Red Queen into a full gallop. Thus, the cost of the short-term decrease in the number of infections is the spread of new epitope mutations in the future. The extent to which vaccination accelerates evolution in antibody-binding regions depends on vaccination frequency, inter-dose period, molecular design of vaccines, and details of immunological and evolutionary dynamics. To avoid confusion, we emphasize that we discuss here the evolution of epitopes only\n\nFig. 3: **Schematics of the dependence of the population-level viral substitution rate on the proportion of the immune population.** Immune population consists of individuals who recovered from natural infection and who were vaccinated. Using mathematical models, population-level viral substitution rate in epitopes, \\(V\\), can be expressed in terms of the effective number of infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\), and mutation rate, \\(U_{\\phi}\\) defined as the probability of an escape mutation per transmission in epitopes. **a** At a low mutation rate per population per epitope per transmission, \\(N_{\\text{att}}U_{\\phi}<1\\), the supply of immune escape mutations is low. As a consequence, escape mutations spread in the population one at a time. The population-level substitution rate \\(V\\) (black line) is proportional to the immune selection pressure in a population \\(\\delta_{\\text{tot}}\\) (gray line) and the total number of infected individuals where escape mutants can emerge \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\) (red line). The dependence of \\(V\\) on the proportion of the immune population has a maximum (black line). **b** At a high mutation rate, \\(N_{\\text{att}}U_{\\phi}>1\\), many escape mutations at different positions of the viral genome spread in the population at almost the same time and compete with each other for human hosts. The substitution rate \\(V\\) (black line) is proportional to selection pressure \\(\\delta_{\\text{int}}\\) (gray line) and weakly depends on \\(N_{\\text{att}}\\) (red line), so that \\(V\\) increases monotonically with the proportion of the immune population. **a**, **b** Blue people are recovered orange, yellow, and red people are infected with viral variants with different immune escape mutations (genomes below). The evolution of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is compatible with **b** and not with **a** (see text).\n\n and not, for example, the emergence of VOC related to mutations in other regions. Before Omicron and its descendants, all VOCs had emerged before the mass rollout of vaccination as inferred from phylogenetic analyses [106, 107]. Vaccination was probably not involved as a selection pressure in their genesis.\n\nJust to illustrate the potential magnitude of the Red Queen effect, let us make a ballpark estimate. In the case of high vaccination coverage combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions, we observe a sharp short-term drop in the total number of currently infected individuals, \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\). The long-term impact of the decrease in the number of infected individuals on viral evolution in epitopes can be found from the substitution rate, \\(V\\). As already mentioned, all multi-locus models demonstrate that \\(V\\) depends logarithmically on both \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\) and mutation rate, \\(U_{b}\\)[108].\n\nFor example, if vaccination has decreased the number of infected individuals in a city 100-fold from 10,000 to 100, the corresponding decrease in the virus substitution rate is only two-fold. This is a drastically different result from a 100-fold reduction expected from the simpler models assuming rare immune escape mutations where the substitution rate is linearly proportional to product \\(N_{\\text{inf}}\\)\\(U_{b}\\). The same consideration applies to parameter \\(U_{b}\\) which has been argued to depend on the vaccination dose in a vaccinated host [78, 79]. The effect of a change in \\(U_{b}\\) on \\(V\\) is very small (i.e., logarithmic). At the same time, the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is linearly proportional to the selection pressure, \\(s\\), created by the individuals with natural or vaccine-induced immunity [73, 74, 75], Eq. 1 (Fig. 4).\n\nThus, vaccination creates two opposing effects on the Red Queen adaptation in epitopes. One effect comes from the decrease in transmission rate due to partial immune protection and lower virus amount transmitted to another individual. This effect creates a positive selection pressure for resistant mutations. The opposite effect of vaccination comes from the decrease in the mutation rate within a host, due to lower viral load. The first effect wins, because the adaptation rate is linearly proportional to selection pressure, \\(s\\), and weakly depends on the mutation rate, \\(U_{b}\\) (Fig. 3b).\n\nSeveral studies [78, 80, 81] use standard compartmental infectious disease models and arguments following those to predict that vaccination can decrease vaccine escape by reducing the number of infectious individuals. We would like to point out that the aforementioned studies lack evolutionary dynamics because it is not built into these simplified models. For example, ref. [80] assume the vaccine escape pressure to be proportional to the number of vaccinated individuals. At best, models of this type correspond to the case when immune escape mutations emerge and spread through the population one at a time (single-site approximation or independent-locus models; Fig. 3a). As we explain above, this is the case for unrealistically-small population sizes. These models do not include proper treatment of evolutionary dynamics and disregard linkage effects existing between mutations at multiple sites, because such models are technically more difficult to handle. Here, we use the modern theory of multi-locus virus evolution that takes into account clonal interference, genetic background effect, and other linkage effects, random genetic drift, and natural selection arising due to immune memory. From the evolutionary viewpoint, multi-locus models are closer to reality than independent-locus models. At the same time, based on strong genetic variation in the antibody epitopes in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we assumed that mutations in these regions have a low cost, by analogy with mutations in hemagglutinin of influenza. The validity of these assumptions remains to be tested directly in the future.\n\n### ", "Estimation of the vaccination effect on the substitution rate in epitopes": "\n\nThe modeling results obtained for natural immunity [73, 74, 75] can be generalized for immunity induced by vaccination. Due to the immune response in vaccinated individuals the total selection pressure of escape, denoted \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\), is increased by an additional term, denoted \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\), as follows\n\n\\[s_{\\text{tot}}=s+s_{\\text{vac}}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(s\\) is given by Eq. 1, and \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\) corresponds to the effect of vaccination averaged over time. Because the substitution rate, \\(V\\), is linearly proportional to the selection pressure, Eq. 1, it increases linearly with the vaccination term, \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\). The selection pressure due to vaccination, \\(s_{\\text{vac}}\\), depends on the type of vaccine and the epitopes it exposes to the immune system. It also depends on vaccination frequency and the period between vaccine doses which determine the average genetic distance between the vaccine vector and the currently circulating viral variant. The more recent the vaccine vector is the stronger selection pressure to escape immune response in vaccinated individuals it exerts on the virus. This relationship is determined by an important immunological parameter, termed \"cross-immunity function\" that represents the decrease in the host susceptibility with the genetic distance \\(x\\) between the infecting virus and a virus from which the individual recovered in the past [78, 73, 74, 75]. The form of the cross-immunity function determines the cross-recognition of epitope variants and may vary among epitopes, host organisms, and viruses. Reconstructing this function in each case remains a challenge but one can estimate from viral genome sequence data the cross-reactivity half-distance, i.e., the genetic distance where the host susceptibility is half of that in a naive individual. For example, for influenza A H3N2 the cross-reactivity half-distance of 15 amino acid substitutions has been inferred for humans [73] and measured for equines [109]. For SARS-CoV-2, these estimates are still to be determined.\n\nTo get an idea about the magnitude of the effect of vaccination on the substitution rate in epitopes, let us consider a simple example. We assume (i) a vector vaccine similar to Sputnik V or that generated by AstraZeneca that has the entire spike protein\n\nFig. 4: **Schematics of the dependence of the substitution rate on the proportions of vaccinated and recovered population and on the relative efficacy of vaccine compared to the natural immune response.** The substitution rate in epitopes is shown in the presence (three higher lines) and in the absence (three lower lines) of recovered individuals as the proportion of the vaccinated population increases. Red, green, and blue lines correspond to vaccine efficacy in inducing protection against infection equal, lower, and higher than the natural immune response. We assume the absence of fully susceptible (na\u00efve) individuals.\n\n with the same epitopes as the natural virus; (ii) vaccine vector is based on a virus variant similar to a variant that infected a typical individual recovered from natural infection; (iii) immunity after natural infection and vaccination are similar. Suppose that 1% of the population are na\u00efve susceptible, 9% of the population had a natural infection and recovered, and the remaining 90% of individuals were vaccinated. With these assumptions, we have 90/9 = 10-fold more individuals with vaccine-induced than natural immunity, and hence \\(s_{\\text{suc}}\\sim 10s\\). If \\(\\log N_{\\text{inf}}\\) decreases due to vaccination by the factor of 2, as we estimated above, the substitution rate, which is proportional to both \\(s_{\\text{tot}}\\) and \\(\\log N_{\\text{inf}}\\), increases by the factor of \\(\\sim 1/2\\times 10\\,=\\,5\\).\n\nIf the ratio of the recovered and vaccinated was different from 1:10, the effect on the substitution rate in epitopes would differ from this estimate. The schematic of the dependence of the substitution rate in epitopes for varying proportions of vaccinated and recovered population is shown in Fig. 4. The case of some African countries which had multiple waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly any vaccination corresponds to a small proportion of the vaccinated population (extreme case: 0%). The case of some European countries with massive vaccination efforts corresponds to a very high proportion of the vaccinated population (extreme cases 100% achieved in, e.g., the Portuguese elderly). Seasonal influenza with its annual vaccination campaigns in many countries with temperate climates would also correspond to a rather small proportion of the vaccinated population, as compared to the global mass vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 realized within 2 years.\n\nWe also assumed that the effects of vaccinal and natural immune response on selection pressure are the same. In fact, such symmetry is unlikely, because the number of immune memory cells against an epitope induced by vaccination and natural infection may differ. Figure 4 shows schematically how the substitution rate in epitopes changes with the relative protection (and hence, the selection pressure on epitopes) rendered by the vaccine as compared to the natural infection (compare the red line with the green and blue lines). In addition, vaccines are composed of a section of the spike protein, and the immune system generates antibodies against other viral proteins as well. Thus, the effect of vaccination on the substitution rate in an epitope can be either stronger or weaker than the effect of the natural immune response. Furthermore, the genomic regions where evolution is accelerated will also differ between vaccinal and natural responses. A detailed study based on a mathematical model and immunological data is required to calculate the acceleration of evolution in various epitopes.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, in our example, almost everyone is either recovered or vaccinated, and the overlap between the two groups is neglected. In reality, there are many people who first recovered from natural infection and then got vaccinated, and vice versa. The overlap might lead to a further increase in the speed of evolution, due to the combined effect of natural and induced immunity, however, the interaction between the two is not trivial.\n\nTo summarize, we arrived at very different conclusions regarding the effect of vaccination on the speed of antigenic evolution compared to the previous work [78, 80, 81] by exploiting the similarities in the molecular structure of antibody-binding regions of different viruses and using the modern theory of multi-locus evolution driven by the immune response. The above example illustrates that, despite the reduction of viral transmission by vaccination, viral evolution in neutralizing antibody epitopes may be accelerated by vaccination several-fold. The transient decrease in the number of infections is outweighed by a stronger immune pressure to change. The cost of the transient reduction in virus circulation is the emergence of more transmissible escape mutants and, hence, a higher number of infected individuals in the population in the future.\n\n### ", "Future research": "\n\nIf SARS-CoV-2 continues to cause the substantial burden of severe disease in vulnerable individuals, we should either design a type of vaccine that does not carry any potential danger of accelerating virus evolution in epitopes but is still effective against severe disease, or find other methods of reducing virus circulation. Several research lines could be pursued further to investigate these options.\n\n### ", "Evolution of epitopes": "\n\nThe vaccine design that prevents all virus evolution in antibody-binding regions is not obvious. If we use a vaccine based on old strains, with a large genetic distance to the current strain to keep selection pressure at bay, it would not protect against the virus well. If a vaccine is based on recent strains, it would protect well but it would create a strong selection pressure to change epitopes. We could gain an initial understanding of how to develop an optimal vaccination strategy using mathematical models that combine SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and evolution [64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]. Models of this type could predict the substitution rate in epitopes as a function of relevant vaccination parameters, and should be extended to include age-dependent transmission, vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacies against different outcomes (infection, severe disease, hospitalization, and death), and the genetic distance of the vaccine vector to the current variant. Using an age-structured model, we can find model parameters (e.g., age-specific vaccination coverages) that balance the decrease in infection incidence against the extra selection pressure due to vaccination, for various vaccination objectives. An example of the objective could be optimizing the substitution rate against the number of hospitalizations and deaths in vulnerable individuals in the long term.\n\nThe Red Queen process is observed in neutralizing antibody epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 [47] that are not functionally critical to the virus and hence can mutate without much decrease in \\(R_{0}\\) (low mutation cost). Virus evolution due to such low cost of mutations causes a rather rapid decrease in protection after infection or vaccination. This leads to the need for repeated rounds of vaccination potentially further accelerating virus evolution. However, SARS-CoV-2 is controlled also by other important immune mechanisms such as helper CD4 T-cells and cytotoxic CD8 T-cells (CTL) [110]. CTL immune response in a host lowers the viral load and hence the transmission rate at the population level. This effect is incorporated in the reproduction number, \\(R_{0}\\), which affects the selection pressure of antigenic escape, as given by Eq. 1. The waning antibody protection after vaccination may not necessarily lead to full susceptibility to severe disease because the immune system's memory for T-cells can soften the consequences of repeated infection [18].\n\nThe selection pressure at the population level for CTL epitopes to mutate is smaller than for antibody-binding regions. Indeed, their location depends on a highly-variable HLA-subtype and hence varies between individuals. Furthermore, the cost of mutation in CTL epitopes is not as low as for antibody-binding regions in receptor proteins that evolved to mutate easily. The mutation cost of T-cell epitopes is distributed broadly. It varies from very functionally important and hence \"expensive\" epitopes, where more longevity is expected, to epitopes with a low cost where the virus can mutate because the loss of recognition outweighs the cost of mutation. The mutational trajectory for CTL epitopes and their mutation cost have been studied intensely in the context of HIV infection [58, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116]. It has been predicted that CTL epitope mutations start from a cheap mutation with a large loss of recognition moving towards more expensive mutations with a larger cross-reactivity [60]. This accumulated experience may help to develop T-cell vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in the future.\n\n**Evolution of fitness.** In addition to the evolution in epitopes relevant to immune protection that we have considered before, SARS-CoV-2 evolves almost everywhere in the genome producing new VOCs with increased transmissibility and changed virulence. For example, Omicron B.1 and BA.2 were more transmissible and less virulent, while there was evidence for increased virulence for Alpha and Delta VOCs [8]. In order to predict the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 properly, we need to know which positions in the viral genome are easier and which are harder to mutate. In other words, we must know the fitness landscape including the fitness effects of individual mutations, the interactions between them and, ultimately, the fitness of entire viral variants. The fitness landscape can be determined directly from viral genome sequence data using a toolbox of new methods developed within the last decade. The fitness of viral variants can be estimated by phylogenetic methods [67, 117] with the use of machine learning. The fitness effects of mutations and their interactions can be found from the short-term extrapolation of variant dynamics in time [71] or from rather popular statistical methods based on the so-called \"quasi-linkage equilibrium\" approximation that neglects genetic linkage between evolving residues [118]. The method was applied to related species for proteins of various organisms [119, 120, 121, 122, 123], and recently, to SARS-CoV-2 using different species of coronavirus [124]. A recent method developed for the multi-locus regime that does not neglect genetic linkage and hence can be applied to genome sequence data from either different species or to the same species, also permits to predict fitness effects of mutations and their interactions [125, 126]. The availability of these and related methods makes us confident that soon we will have accurate and regularly updated fitness maps of SARS-CoV-2, enabling the prediction of its potential genetic trajectories to the extent made possible by current methods.\n\n**Evolution of virulence.** Devising future vaccination strategies will require predicting the evolution of virulence. This topic remains a major concern and must be a subject of additional research. Although viruses sometimes decrease virulence to adapt to a host population like seasonal coronaviruses, this is not the general rule. Various models suggest that the evolution towards the increase of virulence does not need to be monotonous in the sense of continuing virulence decrease [127, 128, 129]. Some modeling studies demonstrate that the selection for low virulence quantified by mortality is rather weak [130, 129]. Indeed, severe outcomes or death occur late into infection, after the person has already infected most of the potential contacts and has been isolated. The general evolution of virulence is determined, primarily, as the evolution towards maximizing the reproduction number, controlled by the trade-off between two factors [127, 128]. One factor is the increase in viral fitness due to increased infectivity and transmitted dose. The other factor is the decrease in the period where infected individuals infect others, which is limited by the death or the onset of severe symptoms.\n\nThe direction of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virulence is rather complex, difficult to predict, and has been a topic of debate since the beginning of the pandemic [128, 129, 130]. More virulent variants of SARS-CoV-2 have evolved and could still arise in the future if they have higher transmissibility [130]. The Alpha variant was more virulent than the original variant [131], Delta was more virulent than Alpha, but Omicron BA.1/BA.2 was much less virulent than Delta. There are also numerous examples where evolution within a host is the cause of virulence. For example, the evolution of polio is the reason for brain damage [132], and HIV evolution is a possible reason for the onset of AIDS symptoms [133]. HIV does not decrease its virulence in time and kills almost all infected individuals if left untreated. A highly virulent variant of HIV-1 was recently found in the Netherlands [134]. It is also not clear whether SARS-CoV-2 could evolve towards higher virulence in younger age groups [127, 17]. If this possibility is ever realized, it could have major consequences for COVID-19 control.\n\n**Origin of VOCs.** Another puzzle important to solve for devising future vaccination strategies for vulnerable individuals is the origin of VOCs that have dozens of new mutations at once, with a temporary acceleration of the evolution rate [8, 135]. Alternative theories of the emergence of VOCs [19] include reverse zoonosis, evolution within immunocompromised patients with chronic infection [136, 137, 138], and evolution in subpopulations not covered by genetic surveillance. To all these diverse hypotheses, we can add the fitness valley effect, a cascade emergence of compensating mutations following a primary mutation inferred for HIV and influenza [139, 126]. Primary mutations in HIV are caused by the early immune response in CTL epitopes. Because these primary mutations decrease the ability of the virus to replicate, mutations on sites located outside of epitopes partly compensating for this decrease come under positive selection. Alleles with a stronger epistatic interaction with the primary sites sweep first [139]. About half of the epitopes do not undergo antigenic escape and are left to limit virus replication [58, 140]. The effect could be investigated using methods developed to measure interactions between mutations at different genomic locations [141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147].\n\nThe emergence of VOCs could also have to do with the effects of natural selection and recombination. The latter occurs when two or more viral variants fuse their genetic material into a new variant during a co-infection in a host. Natural selection and recombination could group and amplify a broadly variable number of beneficial mutations. A deeper insight into SARS-CoV-2 recombination [143, 144, 145, 146, 147] is therefore needed to understand its potential implications for future vaccination plans. To quantify recombination, we need to estimate the effective outcrossing number between different SARS-CoV-2 variants that is currently unknown. This number, in principle, can be inferred from genomic samples by fitting the results of simulated models. Methods previously developed to quantify recombination using genome sequence data for HIV could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as well [148]. The outcrossing number for SARS-CoV-2 could be quite large due to the possibility of co-infection during super-spreading events [149, 150, 151, 152].\n\n**Vaccine design.** From a practical viewpoint, SARS-CoV-2 as a public health problem could be solved by pursuing a better vaccine design. The protection mechanism of current vaccines is based on eliciting in vaccinated individuals the neutralizing antibody response against spike protein that imitates the response after natural infection. However, the virus evolved a specific design of spike similar to anti-receptors of HIV and influenza [153]. The receptor-binding site that serves for cell entrance is hidden from antibodies, and it has a conserved sequence. In contrast, the protruding regions of the spike exposed to antibodies are not functionally important and can easily mutate to decrease anti-body binding.\n\nThe question is then how to achieve vaccine designs that increase the cost of escape mutations. Attempts to produce synthetic vaccines from chosen sets of conserved virus epitopes prove difficult due to the protein folding of the constructs that hide the intended epitopes from antibodies. Another direction could be therapeutic antibodies or next-generation vaccines based on broadly neutralizing antibodies that target conserved regions of the spike protein and thus make escape more difficult [154]. The immune system mounts the T-cell response against SARS-CoV-2 [155]. The development of T-cell-based vaccines is also interesting because some epitopes may be too expensive to mutate. This effect was observed before in HIV [111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116] and could be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 as well.\n\n**Defective interfering particles and other options**. Live vaccines could be another option. Their modern formulations could be based on the concept of defective interfering particles (DIPs). DIPs are parasites of parasites, i.e., viruses that cannot exist without the main virus because they lack critically important proteins. In addition to suppressing the virus by stealing its proteins [156, 157, 158, 159], a DIP can also serve as a live vaccine eliciting an immune response [160]. Prototypes of DIPs demonstrating both in-host viral suppression and vaccination properties have been recently developed for SARS-CoV-2 [156, 160]. Importantly, a DIP is under pressure to co-evolve with the main virus and may be actually co-stable [157, 158]. Next-generation medicines such as oral antiviral agents and monoclonal antibody prophylaxis will also be needed, especially for immunocompromised people for whom vaccination is not effective.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMass vaccination has been very effective in reducing deaths, severe disease, and overall disease burden due to COVID-19 in many countries. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to escape to some extent from both natural and vaccine-induced immunity. From this Perspective, we discussed the possibility that global vaccination may accelerate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in rapidly mutating antibody-binding regions compared to natural infection. Our conclusions rely on the assumption that immune selection pressure acting on the antibody-binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, and on existing multi-locus models of influenza evolution. To this end, we took advantage of the similarity between the envelope proteins of the two viruses and the evidence of strong genetic variation in the antibody epitopes. The validity of our assumption remains to be tested directly for SARS-CoV-2 in the future, as it was done for the influenza virus. The potential impact of vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 evolution should be acknowledged for future vaccination strategies that target most at-risk populations, especially if vaccination campaigns will cover a substantial part of the population. Mutations in immunologically-relevant genomic regions, viral recombination, virulence, and fitness evolution must be considered when designing a future vaccination strategy. Finally, we would like to stress that despite the potential implications of vaccination for evolution in the antibody epitopes, in the face of an unprecedented global health crisis like the one we just experienced, mass vaccination is probably the only tool to prevent widespread loss of human lives and huge economic costs.\n\n## ", "References": "\n\n* [1] Perra, N.

Disruption to healthcare can disrupt IPC and Public Health activities, such as vaccination programmes [6, 7, 8]. High incidence of traumatic bone and soft-tissue injuries in people exposed to the conflict necessitates damage-control surgery, which is often delivered in informal facilities that lack the usual infection controls, resulting in wounds being more easily contaminated with environmental organisms [8, 9]. To address these issues, healthcare providers use broad-spectrum antibiotics, which can also increase development of AMR [10]. More recently, conflict-related heavy metal contamination of the environment has been raised as a possible driver for the emergence of novel mechanisms of resistance [7].\n\n### Multidrug-resistant organisms associated with conflict\n\nMultidrug-resistant (MDR) _Acinetobacter baumanii_ complex was recognised as a significant issue among US military personnel following combat-related injuries in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2004 (Fig. 1) [11]. Similarly in the UK, imported MDR _A. baumanii_ from Iraq and Afghanistan has been recognised as a potential source of severe nosocomial infection [5, 12, 13]. The ability of _A. baumanii_ to rapidly develop resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics has increased appreciation of its clinical significance in nosocomial infection [8]. Early use of molecular typing methods has demonstrated the potential for clonal outbreaks of MDRO in healthcare settings (Fig. 1) (although it has, as yet, been unable to delineate chains of transmission), with particular risk in intensive care and burns units. There is also the potential to seed plumbing systems, where spread can compromise both individual patient care and operational capability of the service [8, 14].\n\nMilitary and civilian war casualties transferred from Libya to German hospitals were also observed to be colonised with high rates of MDRO [15]. Among 67 patients transferred during 2016-2017, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and MDROs were observed in 16% and 60% respectively including 37 isolates producing carbamemasses (such as NewDelhi metallob beta-lactamase (NDM): 17, oxacillinase (OXA)\\(-\\)48: 15, OXA-23: 9) [15]. Carbapenamases are \\(\\beta\\)-lactamases, enzymes that often confer resistance to antimicrobial agents, including to the antibiotics that are used when AMR is known to be a problem, known as last line antibiotics [15]. Among Syrian war casualties requiring surgery between 2011-2013, MDROs accounted for 69% surgical site infections, including high rates of MDR _A. baumanii_, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing _E.coli_ and MRSA [16]. Studies from Syria, neighbouring countries and European hospitals have reported increased incidences of MDRO carriage linked to the Syrian conflict, in particular Enterobacterates producing ESBL-enzymes or NDM enzymes and MDR _A. baumanii_ in 33-83% of individuals [17]. Conflict can also severely limit national and regional antimicrobial supply chains and the capacity to engage in stewardship (an organised programme to promote appropriate use of antimicrobials and preserve their future usefulness). This type of stewardship is often limited or missing even before conflict\n\nFig. 1: **Map showing movement of focibly displaced peoples during conflicts in Ukraine, Afghanistan and Syria as of 2022 and the associated antimicrobial resistance pressures. The coloured arrows show people predominantly moved to neighbouring countries. Of those displaced from their country of origin and in need of international protection, over half originated from conflicts associated with these three countries [5]. Example 1 (red; Ukraine), the proportion of AMR microbes isolated from patients with infections of war-related injuries increased considerably in 2022 compared to 2021. Data was obtained from nationally collected surveillance data (2021: https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bistreams/1496762/retrieve; accessed 07 July 2023) and EUCAST supported sentinel susceptibility testing (2022) [22] in the context of eruption of major widespread conflict in March 2022 Example 2 (green, Syrian Arab Republic) highlights that availability of antibiotics decreased during the conflict which led to a critical shortage and loses of drug supply security [17, 18]. Example 3 (blue; Afghanistan) highlights molecular typing research that showed potential chains of transmission of AMR spread to the destination countries [19]. Panels on the right demonstrate the top 10 destination locations for displaced populations for each example, with the number who moved stated and the proportion received by destination countries in the bar chart.** commenced. Prior to the eruption of conflict, Syria produced 90% of its domestic antibiotic requirement and almost USD200 million from export regionally[18]. Since then, the United Nations has announced critical shortages in antibiotic availability in Syria and studies from 2015 demonstrate the vast majority of antibiotics are now sold within the country without a prescription[18], further reducing the ability to ensure drug quality or control supply (Fig. 1).\n\nRecent experience following the war in UkraineThe conflict currently occurring in Ukraine represents the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War (www.unhr.org/hk/en/73141-ukraine-fastest-growing-refuge- crisis-in-europe-since-wwi.html; accessed 07 July 2023). Prior to the outbreak of widespread conflict in 2022, Ukraine submitted surveillance data to the Central Asian and European Surveillance of AMR network that suggested increasing rates of MDRO (https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1496762/retrieve; accessed 07 July 2023), particularly among military personnel and likely driven by injudicious antimicrobial use and limited capacity for IPC practices in management of casualties sustained since the annevation of areas of Ukraine by Russia in 2014[19]. Early, limited data suggests the eruption of widespread conflict has considerably exacerbated this issue[20, 21, 22]. The Netherlands national MDRO surveillance system has reported 58 patients with recent travel from Ukraine, of which half had recent hospital exposure in Ukraine prior to travel, in striking contrast to their pre-war experience where no MDROs associated with Ukrainian travel had been detected[20]. Increasing numbers of MDR _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolates that produce NDM-1 or NDM-1/OXA-48 were reported in the Netherlands[20]. This has also been seen in Germany[21], with whole genome sequencing showing predominance of ST147 and ST307 (successful epidemic clones) disseminated from Ukraine and followed by onward transmission within Germany[21].\n\nSentinel testing (random testing to provide data that is potentially representative of the targeted condition at the hospital level) of hospitalised individuals with infected, war-related injuries in Ukraine during 2022 revealed most Gram negative isolates were resistant to the antibiotic micropennor (58%), with K. _pneumonia_ (76%) and _A. baumanii_ (73%) producing NDM and OXA-48 carbapenemase enzymes predominating[22]. Of concern, nine (_K.pneumonia_) were resistant to all antimicrobials tested[21]. Extended AST demonstrated high rates of resistance to a range of f-lactam \\(\\beta\\)-lactamase inhibitor combinations (often last line antibiotic options for MDROs), including ceftaglime-avi-bactam, as well as cefidercol[22]. Clinical outcome data for treating war-related infected injuries is severely limited, but such reports will be important to identify the most suitable antimicrobials for post-injury and peri-operative guidelines[23].\n\n### Recommendations from prior experience\n\nEffective IPC can be difficult to achieve for populations displaced due to conflict[8]. Implementation of basic practices, including hand hygiene, isolation of patients or keeping patients with the same infections together, have been shown to reduce further spread during conflict-associated _A. baumanii_ outbreaks[8]. Strong IPC experience and leadership, strict adherence to basic precautions, and development and implementation of standardised guidelines relevant to the particular context along the entire patient care pathway is essential[8]. This should be provided in parallel to antimicrobial stewardship, supported by adequate diagnostics, to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics and prevent spread of MDRO[8], Emergency medical care in these environments is often delivered by an array of organisations ranging from redeployed host country workforce, the United Nations, the World Health Organisation (WHO) or Allied nation militaries to non-governmental organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres. Active collaboration is needed to optimise provision of expertise and the potential to conduct surveillance to reduce the spread of AMR at each point along the patient pathway.\n\nGiven the high rates of MDRO observed in patients from Ukraine, screening and isolation when people from conflict areas are admitted to hospitals in other countries is recommended[20, 21]. This seems reasonable pending further characterisation of the risk factors for MDRO carriage among both military and civilian populations, such as prior contact with healthcare services in the conflict area, time since move to alternative country and prior history of conflict-related injury. But care should be taken to explain screening to patients to avoid feelings of discrimination among forcibly displaced and vulnerable populations.\n\n### What else is needed going forward\n\nCurrently, reports on conflict-related MDRO incidence from those admitted to European hospitals have been limited by low patient numbers[20, 21, 22, 23]. A greater understanding of MDRO carriage and infection in both military and civilian peoples following conflict would benefit patient care and outcomes in addition to decreasing the risk of MDRO pathogens spreading unchecked across healthcare facilities globally[23]. Studies of MDRO carriage and infection among the general population and hospitalised patients need to be ambitious to be representative. Such data could inform targeted antimicrobial policy, and limit the need to use empiric broad-spectrum perioperative and point-of-wounding antibiotics[23]. The provision of support to nations experiencing conflict should ideally focus on capacity building to enable sustained capability and delivery of in-country surveillance. In February 2023, the WHO published guidance on methods to optimise nationally representative surveys for those countries with limited surveillance capacity (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/366150). Adoption of minimal data sets and utilising readily available key resistance indicator antibiotic susceptibility disc testing, could help maximise data representation and highlight isolates for further testing[24]. Where possible, use of molecular assays or bench side tests such as carbapapemase lateral flow immunoassays could then provide valuable insight to prevalent resistance mechanisms. This will be integral to understanding the differential risk across population groups at each point along the patient pathway.\n\nCurrently, surveillance strategies for many nations are driven by individual National Action Plans[2] By necessity, these plans need to be developed, ratified and implemented by individual nations. Severe reduction in capability to conduct AMR surveillance, such as that seen during conflict, compounds a lack of data and further exacerbates the challenges of raising awareness. An additional level of international strategy, specifically aiming to support countries experiencing conflict, would be globally beneficial to reduce AMR burden. This should also involve provision of IPC training, where required, as a key aspect to reduce further spread of conflict-related AMR[25]. This may be best facilitated by regional WHO offices with support from regional public health bodies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHuman conflict is an important driver of AMR with consequences for healthcare systems globally. Adherence to IPC precautions at all stages of healthcare contact is key to reducing further spread of MDRO. Surveillance studies are required to inform both risk and appropriate antimicrobial guidelines, but must be ambitious to be representative and will probably require support from neighbouring countries and regional public bodies. The need for such collaboration will require considerable policy development at the international level and, given their role in supporting the development of National Action Plans, may best be coordinated by the Regional Offices of the WHO.\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Pennington, H.

Data was obtained from nationally collected surveillance data (2021: https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bistreams/1496762/retrieve; accessed 07 July 2023) and EUCAST supported sentinel susceptibility testing (2022) [22] in the context of eruption of major widespread conflict in March 2022 Example 2 (green, Syrian Arab Republic) highlights that availability of antibiotics decreased during the conflict which led to a critical shortage and loses of drug supply security [17, 18]. Example 3 (blue; Afghanistan) highlights molecular typing research that showed potential chains of transmission of AMR spread to the destination countries [19]. Panels on the right demonstrate the top 10 destination locations for displaced populations for each example, with the number who moved stated and the proportion received by destination countries in the bar chart.** commenced. Prior to the eruption of conflict, Syria produced 90% of its domestic antibiotic requirement and almost USD200 million from export regionally[18]. Since then, the United Nations has announced critical shortages in antibiotic availability in Syria and studies from 2015 demonstrate the vast majority of antibiotics are now sold within the country without a prescription[18], further reducing the ability to ensure drug quality or control supply (Fig. 1).\n\nRecent experience following the war in UkraineThe conflict currently occurring in Ukraine represents the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War (www.unhr.org/hk/en/73141-ukraine-fastest-growing-refuge- crisis-in-europe-since-wwi.html; accessed 07 July 2023). Prior to the outbreak of widespread conflict in 2022, Ukraine submitted surveillance data to the Central Asian and European Surveillance of AMR network that suggested increasing rates of MDRO (https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1496762/retrieve; accessed 07 July 2023), particularly among military personnel and likely driven by injudicious antimicrobial use and limited capacity for IPC practices in management of casualties sustained since the annevation of areas of Ukraine by Russia in 2014[19]. Early, limited data suggests the eruption of widespread conflict has considerably exacerbated this issue[20, 21, 22]. The Netherlands national MDRO surveillance system has reported 58 patients with recent travel from Ukraine, of which half had recent hospital exposure in Ukraine prior to travel, in striking contrast to their pre-war experience where no MDROs associated with Ukrainian travel had been detected[20]. Increasing numbers of MDR _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolates that produce NDM-1 or NDM-1/OXA-48 were reported in the Netherlands[20]. This has also been seen in Germany[21], with whole genome sequencing showing predominance of ST147 and ST307 (successful epidemic clones) disseminated from Ukraine and followed by onward transmission within Germany[21].\n\nSentinel testing (random testing to provide data that is potentially representative of the targeted condition at the hospital level) of hospitalised individuals with infected, war-related injuries in Ukraine during 2022 revealed most Gram negative isolates were resistant to the antibiotic micropennor (58%), with K. _pneumonia_ (76%) and _A. baumanii_ (73%) producing NDM and OXA-48 carbapenemase enzymes predominating[22]. Of concern, nine (_K.pneumonia_) were resistant to all antimicrobials tested[21]. Extended AST demonstrated high rates of resistance to a range of f-lactam \\(\\beta\\)-lactamase inhibitor combinations (often last line antibiotic options for MDROs), including ceftaglime-avi-bactam, as well as cefidercol[22]. Clinical outcome data for treating war-related infected injuries is severely limited, but such reports will be important to identify the most suitable antimicrobials for post-injury and peri-operative guidelines[23].\n\n### ", "Recommendations from prior experience": "\n\nEffective IPC can be difficult to achieve for populations displaced due to conflict[8]. Implementation of basic practices, including hand hygiene, isolation of patients or keeping patients with the same infections together, have been shown to reduce further spread during conflict-associated _A. baumanii_ outbreaks[8]. Strong IPC experience and leadership, strict adherence to basic precautions, and development and implementation of standardised guidelines relevant to the particular context along the entire patient care pathway is essential[8]. This should be provided in parallel to antimicrobial stewardship, supported by adequate diagnostics, to reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics and prevent spread of MDRO[8], Emergency medical care in these environments is often delivered by an array of organisations ranging from redeployed host country workforce, the United Nations, the World Health Organisation (WHO) or Allied nation militaries to non-governmental organisations such as Medecins Sans Frontieres. Active collaboration is needed to optimise provision of expertise and the potential to conduct surveillance to reduce the spread of AMR at each point along the patient pathway.\n\nGiven the high rates of MDRO observed in patients from Ukraine, screening and isolation when people from conflict areas are admitted to hospitals in other countries is recommended[20, 21]. This seems reasonable pending further characterisation of the risk factors for MDRO carriage among both military and civilian populations, such as prior contact with healthcare services in the conflict area, time since move to alternative country and prior history of conflict-related injury. But care should be taken to explain screening to patients to avoid feelings of discrimination among forcibly displaced and vulnerable populations.\n\n### ", "What else is needed going forward": "\n\nCurrently, reports on conflict-related MDRO incidence from those admitted to European hospitals have been limited by low patient numbers[20, 21, 22, 23]. A greater understanding of MDRO carriage and infection in both military and civilian peoples following conflict would benefit patient care and outcomes in addition to decreasing the risk of MDRO pathogens spreading unchecked across healthcare facilities globally[23]. Studies of MDRO carriage and infection among the general population and hospitalised patients need to be ambitious to be representative. Such data could inform targeted antimicrobial policy, and limit the need to use empiric broad-spectrum perioperative and point-of-wounding antibiotics[23]. The provision of support to nations experiencing conflict should ideally focus on capacity building to enable sustained capability and delivery of in-country surveillance. In February 2023, the WHO published guidance on methods to optimise nationally representative surveys for those countries with limited surveillance capacity (https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/366150). Adoption of minimal data sets and utilising readily available key resistance indicator antibiotic susceptibility disc testing, could help maximise data representation and highlight isolates for further testing[24]. Where possible, use of molecular assays or bench side tests such as carbapapemase lateral flow immunoassays could then provide valuable insight to prevalent resistance mechanisms. This will be integral to understanding the differential risk across population groups at each point along the patient pathway.\n\nCurrently, surveillance strategies for many nations are driven by individual National Action Plans[2] By necessity, these plans need to be developed, ratified and implemented by individual nations. Severe reduction in capability to conduct AMR surveillance, such as that seen during conflict, compounds a lack of data and further exacerbates the challenges of raising awareness. An additional level of international strategy, specifically aiming to support countries experiencing conflict, would be globally beneficial to reduce AMR burden. This should also involve provision of IPC training, where required, as a key aspect to reduce further spread of conflict-related AMR[25]. This may be best facilitated by regional WHO offices with support from regional public health bodies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n## ", "Conclusion": "\n\nHuman conflict is an important driver of AMR with consequences for healthcare systems globally. Adherence to IPC precautions at all stages of healthcare contact is key to reducing further spread of MDRO. Surveillance studies are required to inform both risk and appropriate antimicrobial guidelines, but must be ambitious to be representative and will probably require support from neighbouring countries and regional public bodies. The need for such collaboration will require considerable policy development at the international level and, given their role in supporting the development of National Action Plans, may best be coordinated by the Regional Offices of the WHO.\n\n## ", "References": "\n\n* [1] Pennington, H.

Currently, there are no approved treatments that address the underlying genetic cause of this disease, representing a significant unmet need. Mutations in _Plakophilin-2 (PKP2)_, encoding a desmosomal protein, account for approximately 40% of ARVC cases and result in reduced gene expression.\n\n**Methods** Our goal is to examine the feasibility and the efficacy of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression in a cardiac specific knock-out mouse model of _Pkp2_.\n\n**Results** We show that a single dose of AAV9:PKP2 gene delivery prevents disease development before the onset of cardiomyopathy and attenuates disease progression after overt cardiomyopathy. Restoration of PKP2 expression leads to a significant extension of lifespan by restoring cellular structures of desmosomes and gap junctions, preventing or halting decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, preventing or reversing dilation of the right ventricle, ameliorating ventricular arrhythmia event frequency and severity, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling. RNA sequencing analyses show that restoration of _PKP2_ expression leads to highly coordinated and durable correction of _PKP2_-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes, revealing a broad spectrum of biological perturbances behind ARVC disease etiology.\n\n**Conclusions** We identify fundamental mechanisms of PKP2-associated ARVC beyond disruption of desmosome function. The observed PKP2 dose-function relationship indicates that cardiac-selective AAV9:PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising therapeutic approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction1, Clinical presentation of ARVC progresses from a concealed early phase, a later manifestation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and ultimately heart failure that requires heart transplant1, ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1:1000 to 1:5000 with the mean age of presentation before 40 years old2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nFootnote 1: email: agreer-short@tenayathera.com; jane.yang@tenayathera.com\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction1, Clinical presentation of ARVC progress from a concealed early phase, a later manifestation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and ultimately heart failure that requires heart transplant1, ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1:1000 to 1:5000 with the mean age of presentation before 40 years old2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nFootnote 1: email: agreer-short@tenayathera.com; jane.yang@tenayathera.com\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart disease that leads to abnormal heartbeats and a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. ARVC is often caused by changes in a gene called _PKP2_, that then makes less PKP2 protein. PKP2 protein is important for the normal structure and function of the heart. Human ARVC characteristics can be mimicked in a mouse model missing this gene. Given no therapeutic option, our goal was to test if adding a working copy of _PKP2_ gene in the heart of this mouse model, using a technique called gene therapy that can deliver genes to cells, could improve heart function. Here, we show that a single dose of PKP2 gene therapy can improve heart function and heartbeats as well as extend lifespan in mice. PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.\n\n organization of intermediate filaments, cardiac sarcomere, and other organelles [31, 32]. Mutations in the _PKP2_ gene are most commonly heterozygous in patients and lead to haploinsufficiency in PKP2 mRNA and protein [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, cated plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well of 96-well plates or at a seeding density proportional to the well size. A total of 5 million iPSC-CMs flooded three patterned 4Dcell 35 mm dishes. Seeded cells were maintained in CDI maintenance media (FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics) for 7-10 days until the day of treatments.\n\n### siRNA knockdown and AAV transduction\n\nTo knock down endogenous _PKP2_ expression, four independent siRNAs against human _PKP2_ (Invitrogen) were tested to confirm silencing at both mRNA and protein level at time points of 2, 4, 6, and 8 days: 4390843 Silencer Select Negative Control No. 1 siRNA; 4392420 Assay Id 5831202 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#1); 4392420 Assay Id 5831203 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#2); 4392420 Assay Id s531204 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#3); 4392420 Assay Id s10585 Silencer Select Pre-Designed siRNA (#4). RNA sequencing analyses were performed on the above time points using 6-well plates with 4 wells each for the un-transfected, negative control siRNA (sNleg), siRNA #2, #3, or #4 against PKP2 (siPKP2) to select siRNA #3 and #4 for functional characterizations of iPSC-CMs in the presence of acute PKP2 silencing. PKP2 mRNA was silenced on day 2 and silencing persistent up to 8 days (the longest time for mRNA monitored by RT-qPCR). PKP2 protein was silenced up to 8 days (the longest time for protein monitored by Western blotting analysis).\n\nA pool of #3 and #4 siRNAs or individual #3 or #4 siRNAs were used to transfect iPSC-CMs at a final concentration of 1.25 or 5 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in CDI maintenance media. Two days after transfection, medium was removed and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. Cells were fixed at above time points to determine the effectiveness of silencing using antibody staining and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencer Select Negative Control siRNA and siRNA #3 or #4 against _PKP2_ were applied to iPSC-CMs seeded on three 4Dcell 35 mm dishes on day 7 and fixed on day 10 post silencing for immunofluorescence.\n\nAAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CR9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\\({}^{\\underline{c}}\\). This AAV9 variant-based rescue was carried out by AAV transduction at different MOI, multiplicity of infection, on the 3rd day post siRNA-mediated silencing. After overnight transduction of AAV, media was removed the next morning and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. TN-401 expression cassette is composed of a codon optimized human PKP2. The codon optimization renders the coding sequence resistant to siRNA-mediated silencing.\n\n### Evaluation of contractility and electrical signals of iPSC-CMs\n\nContraction of iPSC-CMs was recorded in bright field by SONY SI8000 imaging system and acquired videos were analyzed by DANA Solutions Pulse analysis software (now Curi Bio). Contraction was recorded daily from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction and day 5 to 10 post siRNA treatment. Each siRNA treatment included 6 to 9 wells on two to three independent 96-well plates. Contraction velocity was an average of all wells from the same treatment from the same plate. Averaged numbers of contraction velocity were plotted for each plate from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction. Beat period, amplitude, and propagation of electrical signal were detected as extracellular field potential signals from the cardiac monolayers using Axion Biosystems Microelectrode array (MEA) plates\\({}^{\\underline{c}}\\).\n\nCell seeding and maintenance on 12, 24, or 96-well plates followed the manufacturer's recommendation. Data were collected at the time points and analyzed the same way as the contraction velocity.\n\n### Immunofluorescence imaging of iPSC-CMs\n\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before 15 min and permeabilized with PBS + 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBST) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS three times followed by blocking with PBST + 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells then were incubated with antibodies against PKP2 (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal PAS-53144) at 1:200 dilutions or DSP (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal 25318-1-AP; Sigma, mouse monoclonal MAET1492) at 1:100 dilutions or JUP (Sigma, mouse monoclonal P8087) at 1:200 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for overnight. After washing with PBS three times, cells were then incubated with donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 647 (Invitrogen) at 1:500 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for 2 h. Cells were washed 4 times with DAPI in the final wash, imaged, and acquired on either Leica DMBi inverted microscope with LAXS3.42-Life Science Microscope Software or Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System with MetaXpress 6 imaging analysis software. Confocal images were acquired from 9 independent cell areas for each well in a format of 96-well plates. Images in different fluorescence channels were merged using ImageJ software.\n\n### Echocardiography\n\nTranstracker echocardiography was performed using high resolution micro-imaging systems (Vevo 3100 Systems. Fujifim VisualSonics) equipped with a 25-55 MHz linear array transducer for mouse heart images acquisition. Briefly, lightly anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice (1-1.5% sublimate and 98.5-99% O\\({}_{2}\\)) were placed in the supine position on a temperature-controlled heating platform to maintain their body temperature at -37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. Parastermal long-axis B-mode tracings of right ventricular outflow track (RVOT) were recorded for RV area measurement, parasternal short-axis M-mode tracings of left ventricle (LV) were recorded for left ventricle internal diameter in end diastole (LVIDd) and LV ejection fraction (EF) calculation.\n\n### Electrocardiogram recordings\n\nMice were anesthetized with 1-1.5% isoflurane and 98.5-99% O\\({}_{2}\\) via a nose cone (following induction in a chamber containing isoflurane 4-5% in oxygen). Rectal temperature was monitored continuously and maintained at 37-38 C using a heat pad. Two lead ECG (leads II) were recorded from sterile electrode needles (29-gauge) inserted subcutaneously into the right upper chest with the negative electrode needle and into the left bottom chest with the positive electrode needle. The signal was then acquired and analyzed using a digital acquisition and analysis system (Power Lab; AD Instruments LabChart 7 Pro software version). ECG parameters were quantified after 1-2 min from the stabilized trace. For spontaneous arrhythmias monitoring, mice were monitored for 30 min after anesthesia induction. The arrhythmia severity scoring system is based on these 30-min recordings, please see Supplementary Table 1 for arrhythmia grade chart. This system has limitations, as the short 30-min recording interval and the anesthesia isoflurane can limit the types of arrhythmias observed. All arrhythmias were spontaneously occurring, with no electrical or chemical stimulation used for induction.\n\n### Mouse histology\n\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine cocktail. First, mice were perfused transcardially with PBS. A scalpel was used to cut hearts into two along the coronal plane and drop-fixed overnight in 10% formalin. Fixed heart tissues were sent to Histowiz (https://home.histowiz.com/routine_histology) for trichrome staining and quantification of fibrosis and immunohistochemical staining of PXR2 and Cxd33 using rabbit anti-PKP2 and rabbit anti-Cx43 (PAS-53144 and 71-0700).\n\n### Cardiac mRNA and protein analysis\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from iPSC-CMs or cardiac RV and LV tissue using the RNeasy Mini or Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, 74106 and 73404), cDNA synthesized (Invitrogen SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for RT) and analyzed by qPCR using Taqman probes to human _PKP2_ or mouse _Pb2_ gene, heart failure genes (_Nppa_, _Nppb_), and fibrosis genes (_Col1a1_, _Col3a1_, _Timp1_). Mouse _Gapid_ served as an internal housekeeping gene control. Absolute transgene mRNA copy number was determined by RT-qPCR using a WPRE-specific RNA standard (Script) across six orders of magnitude. WPRE RNA standard sequence and corresponding primers and probe for RT-qPCR are available in Supplementary Data 1.\n\nCardiac LV lysates in RIPA lysis buffer were analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-PKP2, rabbit anti-DSP, mouse anti-JUP, mouse anti-Cx43, and mouse anti-GAPDH (SC-39371, 25318-1-AP, P8087, 35-5000-3D8A5, and MA5-15738, respectively). DSP protein level in both supernatant and pellet was analyzed to ensure a complete evaluation.\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility\n\nThe numbers of technical and biological replicates and animals for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Normality and Informality tests were performed first to determine whether a dataset is normally distributed. Statistical analyses, ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction, and Student's \\(t\\) test were performed using GraphPadPal Prism 9. Significant differences were defined as \\(p<0.05\\). Error bars in all mouse studies represent SEM (Standard Error of the Mean). Error bars in all cell biology studies represent SD (Standard Deviation). Statistical tests for each individual experiment are provided in the figure legend.\n\nStatistical analyses for RNA sequencing data are detailed below.\n\n### Transcriptional analysis by RNA sequencing\n\nFrom each replicate, 100 ng total RNA was extracted via the polyA-tail-specific protocol according to Illumina Inc. RNA quality control was performed before library preparation using Agilent TapeStation instrument. The RNA libraries were prepared using a Stranded Total RNA Library Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (Illumina), which also removes ribosomal RNA. The libraries were sequenced as \\(2\\times 50\\) base pair paired-end reads using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using V1.5 reagent kit on Si flow cell with an average of 25.66 million reads per each read file (51.32 M reads per sample). After adapter trimming by fastr (version 0.23.3), raw RNA-seq reads from mouse hearts in fastr format were aligned with Salmon (version 1.8.0) to the GENCODE (version M30, July 2022) reference transcript assembly (GRCm39 and Ensembl 107) using best practice parameters to ensure mapping validity and reproducibility (-seqBlas ->eBias ->posBlas ->useVBOtt -rangeFactorizationBins - ->validateMappings ->implicitStBT2). Next, a script using R package _tempor_ was used to generate an expression matrix normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). In this analysis, we only used genes detected in at least 10% of all samples. Protein-coding genes were determined using Ensembl release _mus musculus_ annotations (GRCm39, July 2022) and extracted by _ibromRt_ (version 2.52.0). Mitochondrial genes were also omitted, followed by renormalization to TPM. These gene expression values were then log2-transformed after addition of 1 as pseudo-count. Expression patterns of key genes associated with functions of interest were visualized across treatment groups with boxplots generated using the _ggplot2_ R package. Expression values from both left and right ventricles were included in the boxplots. Relative gene expression levels across groups and two ventricles are also presented in scaled values per gene in the heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_ package.\n\nFor initial assessment and identifying presence of cluster patterns in the transcriptome, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models were generated in R using the 'promp' function from the _stats_ package. The first two principal components were used to visualize group level differences across samples in a PCA plot generated using _ggplot2_ and _ggfortify_ packages with the 'autopid' function. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed by comparing each two groups of interest using Welch's \\(t\\) test on pseudo-log normalized TPM values. The obtained \\(t\\) statistics values were used to rank-order the genes for the downstream functional analyses. Volcano plots were then generated to visualize the top positive and negative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the _ggplot2_ R package. The top DEGs are the set of genes with the highest and lowest t-statistics values. To evaluate functional effects, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)\\({}^{\\alpha}\\) on the gene list pre-ranked by t-statistics obtained from differential gene expression analysis, using the _clusterProfiler_ R package. GSEA assesses whether differences in expression of predefined gene sets between two phenotypes are concordant and statistically significant. Gene sets were obtained from positional, curated canonical pathways, transcription factor targets, Gene Ontology, cell type signatures and Hallmark collections in Human MSigDB (v2023.1.Hs)\\({}^{\\alpha+\\alpha}\\). Upon performing GSEA, these gene sets were only considered statistically significant if the false discovery rate (Q value) was less than 0.25 as determined with multiple hypothesis testing correction using the BH-correction method\\({}^{\\beta}\\). The normalized enrichment score, which reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented in the ranked list and normalized for gene set size, was used to select significantly altered gene sets. Trends in normalized enrichment scores for some gene sets of interest were shown in heatmaps, which were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### AAV:PKP2 corrected disease phenotypes in a human iPSC-CM model\n\nTo model ARVC disease and identify the molecular, structural, and functional signatures that are fundamental to the disease mechanisms, we carried out RNA sequencing analyses of iPSC-CMs after acute silencing of _PKP2_ expression. These studies revealed that the desmosome functions as a signaling hub connecting key structures\\({}^{\\alpha}\\) in cardiomyocytes such that reduction in _PKP2_ expression led to down-regulation of structural and functional gene expression encoding components of desmosomes, sarcomere, intermediate filaments, and ion channels (Fig. 1a). Down-regulation of protein was shown for desmoplkin (DSP), plakoglobin (UDP), myosin-binding protein C3 (MyBPC3), and desmin (DES) (Fig. 1b, the left panel and Supplementary Fig. 1). Trending down-regulation of mRNA was shown for sodium voltage-gated channel a subunit 5 (_SCNSA_) (Fig. 1b, the right panel). PKP2 deficiency resulted in structural disappearance of PKP2 and DSP from the cellular membrane and caused cell disarray of patterned iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1c). In addition, PKP2 deficiency perturbed both contractile (Fig. 1d) and electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1e).\n\nThe 1st generation expression cassette was used for iPSC-CM-based studies and the 2nd generation for in vivo mouse efficacy studies (Fig. 2a). Dose-dependent protein expression was evident in iPSC-CMs driven by a cardiac-specific troponin T promoter (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). AAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CRS9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), restored DSP expression post _PKP2_ silencing when compared to the reduced DSP protein without AAV rescue (Fig. 2c, d). AAV:hPKP2 restored contractility as quantified by contraction velocity when compared to the reduced contraction velocity without AAV rescue (Fig. 2e). Using human iPSC-CMs as a cell model for ARVC, AAV:hPKP2 restored desmosomes and rescued contractility in PKP2-deficient iPSC-CMs, suggesting PKP2 governs intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes.\n\n### Pkp2-cKO ARVC mouse model recapitulated the majority of human ARVC clinical manifestations\n\nWe used a mouse conditional knockout model to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of AAV9-mediated _PKP2_ gene replacement. Consistent with the early observations of this model\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), tamoxifen-induced cardiac deletion of both alleles of _Pkp2_ in adult mice did not show over structural and functional changes at 1 week post induction. Tissue collection at the end of the study and weekly monitoring showed disruption of desmosomes and GJs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3), high burden of spontaneous premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Fig. 3b) and occurrences of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (Supplementary Fig. 4), biventricular dilatation (Fig. 3d), and a sharp decline in cardiac function (Fig. 3c) and survival (Fig. 3e) after 3-4 weeks of induced cardiac knock-out of _Pkp2_. These phenotypes recapitulated human ARVC clinical manifestations. However, unlike in humans, heterozygous disruption of _Pkp2_ in mouse hearts did not result in cardiac phenotypes that closely recapitulated human ARVC symptoms [5, 6]. Thus, homozygous _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse was used as a model of human ARVC.\n\n \n\n**TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment largely attenuated disease development and disease progression to mortality in Pkp2-ekO ARVC mouse.** To determine whether the AAV9 expression cassette (Fig. 2a, the 2nd generation) encoding either the human _PKP2_ or the mouse ortholog could counteract the effects of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion, _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given a single systematic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 (AAV9: human PKP2 at 3E13 vg/kg) or AAV9:mPkp2 (AAV9: mouse Pkp2 at 5E13 vg/kg) 3 weeks prior to tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 4a). A lower dose level of the human ortholog was selected to limit the risk of over-expressing the human protein in this mouse model. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was used as the carrier buffer for TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 to prevent aggregation of capsids. It was administered as the vehicle control to WT and to _Pkp2-ekO_ animals. There were 4 experimental groups: 'WT' and 'ekO' were treated with the vehicle and _Pkp2-ekO_ animals treated with either 'TN-401' or 'AAV9:mPkp2' as shown in Fig. 4.\n\nAt 4 weeks post gene deletion and 7 weeks post AAV treatment, human or mouse PKP2 inhibited the development of frequent PVCs and the occurrence of NSVT as summarized by a ventricular arrhythmia score (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Table 1 used as an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia burden), prevented right ventricular remodeling (Fig. 4c), and prevented decline in left ventricular function (Fig. 4d). Frequent PVCs, RV and LV remodeling, and LV function decline were prominent features of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 4 weeks post gene deletion. TN-401 demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing ARVC development and in extending median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 58 weeks, far beyond the 4.7 weeks observed in the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-ekO_ animals (Fig. 4e). In this same study, we also evaluated efficacy of AAV9:mPkp2 in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 3 intervention timepoints and concluded that treatments at 3 weeks before, right after, or 1 week after gene deletion yielded comparable efficacy in EP%, RV remodeling, arrhythmias, and prolonged lifespan of more than 50% of the treated animals by 50 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, these results showed that either the human PKP2 or the ortholog was sufficient to prevent the detrimental cardiac and survival phenotypes of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice when delivered in the AAV9 vector. In addition, we were unable to detect sex difference in either _Pkp2-ekO_ mice or treatment groups (information on sex distribution in each study is detailed in Supplementary Data 1).\n\nTo assess the dose response to TN-401 (Fig. 5) or AAV9:mPkp2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given single systemic treatments via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, and 1E14 vg/kg one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 5a). All animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks post induction (3 weeks post AAV treatment) for histological and expression analyses. TN-401 treatment of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice showed dose-dependent efficacy in preventing decline of LV ejection fraction, reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight, and a trending reduction in arrhythmias (Fig. 5b). This dose-dependent efficacy was confirmed with larger cohorts of animals in significantly improving LV ejection fraction, reducing RV area and arrhythmia burden, and improving survival (Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nAt molecular level, left ventricle heart tissue showed dose-dependent protein expression of human PKP2 (Fig. 5c, the top panel; Western blot images in Supplementary Fig. 7) as well as corresponding restoration of DSP and JUP, two additional desmosome proteins that were decreased in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice (Fig. 5c, the bottom two panels). Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein present at intercalated discs, was reduced in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry of heart tissue, and was restored in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice treated with TN-401 (Fig. 5d, the top row). TN-401 treatment also significantly reduced fibrosis development and collagen deposition in both right ventricle and left ventricle (Fig. 5d, the bottom row) and quantification shown in the right graph). In addition, quantitative analyses of molecular signatures supported that TN-401 treatment reduced mRNA expression of heart failure markers (a significant _Npp_ reduction and a trending _Npp_ reduction), fibrosis, and tissue remodeling genes in the right ventricles (only human PKP2 transgene expression was quantified) (Fig. 5e).\n\nOverall, TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment supported a dose-dependent efficacy in improving ARVC phenotypes in _Pkp2-ekO_ mouse model of ARVC. TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 in the dose-escalation studies demonstrated efficacy at doses \\(\\geq\\)3E13 vg/kg in preventing adverse right ventricular remodeling, and improving ventricular function, fibrosis, and electrophysiological properties.\n\nThe preventive mode of treatment, dosing before overt structural changes, demonstrated significant benefit of early intervention in largely preventing disease development and extending lifespan. To further examine whether ARVC disease progression could be slowed down or attenuated by restoration of PKP2 expression after overt structural changes, the therapeutic mode of treatment, we dos animals via retro-orbital injection of AAV9:mPkp2 at 1E14 vg/kg at 2.5 weeks after cardiac deletion of _Pkp2_ (Fig. 6a). At 2.5 weeks, overt structural changes were observed that coincided with a rapid development of RV dilation, LVEF decline, and significant ventricular arrhythmias (Fig. 3). Note that the rapid mortality presented by this mouse model (within 3-6 weeks of tamoxifen induction) combined with the relatively slow time course of AAV9 transduction and transgene expression make it challenging to perform the therapeutic mode of treatment. However, at 9 weeks post induction, AAV9:mPkp2 prevented further decline of the left ventricle function when compared to the treated animals at 4 weeks (\\(p=0.9416\\), ns) (Fig. 6c, f), reduced and reversed right ventricle enlargement when compared to the WT level (\\(p=0.6856\\), ns) (Fig. 6d, g). Arrhythmia scores showed a trending, but not statistically significant reduction (Fig. 6e, h). This therapeutic mode of treatment reduced mortality throughout one year follow-up with a median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\)50 weeks (Fig. 6b), which is comparable to the survival benefit observed in the preventive mode of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6e).\n\n**Restoration of PKP2 expression led to a highly coordinated and durable correction of PKP2-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes.** It was rather surprising to observe that restoration of a single desmosome component, PKP2, led to significant survival benefits, improved cardiac function, reversed adverse RV remodeling, reduced ventricular arrhythmia frequency and severity, and\n\nFig. 1: **siRNA-mediated acute PKP2 silencing impacted both cellular structure and functions of human IPSC-CMs.** **a** Heatmap of RNA sequencing analyses from IPSC-CMs (\\(n=1\\) for negative control, sixNeg, and \\(n=3\\) biological replicates for siRNAs against PKP2, sIFKP2) harvested only day 2, 4,6, and 8, respectively, after siRNA treatment, highlighting effects on genes encoding components of the desmosome, sarcomere, and alcohol channels.**b** PKP2 silencing led to reduction in protein expression of DSP, JUP, DES, and MyBPC3 in response to reduced PKP2 protein (Western blot on the left panel, day 8, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and a trending reduction in SCNS mRNA in response to reduced PKP2 mRNA (RNA sequencing reads from Fig. 1a), ePKP2 silencing resulted in disappearance of PKP2 and DSP protein from the cellular membrane (top two rows, day 10, \\(n=5\\) technical replicates; IXM confocal microscope; 25 \\(\\mu\\)m) and cell disarray in patterned iPSC-CMs (bottom row).\n\nprevented fibrosis. We asked whether \"on-target\" PKP2 effects possibly extend beyond its effects on the desmosome by evaluating PKP2 dose-dependent response, specifically at the transcriptional level. To our knowledge, there has been no reported study that reveals whether (1) PKP2 dynamically coordinates its gene expression with other desmosome members, and (2) to what extent PKP2 quantitively dictates the state of disease progression. To obtain a deeper understanding, two large-scale RNA sequencing analyses were conducted.\n\n_Pkp2-cKO_ mice were given a single systemic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 3E13 or 6E13 vg/kg one week before tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 7a) and cardiac function and arrhythmias were evaluated at 4 and 9 weeks post induction. Mice were sacrificed at 9 weeks post induction and heart tissues were collected for RNA sequencing and quantification of PKP2 RNA and protein expression. At a 2-fold expression difference between 3E13 ygkg and 6E13 ygkg doses at 9 weeks (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 8), we did not observe significant dose-dependent difference in key readouts of EF %, LV mass, RV dilatation, and arrhythmia score, although one out of six PKP2 silencing and day 8 of AAV transduction, the left bar graph summarized the percentage of cells without GFP (\\(n=12\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and with GFP (\\(n=24\\)-\\(36\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates). The right graph showed restored DSP protein expression quantified by total intensity of immunofluorescence signal for Pkp2 silencing in the absence (\\(n=6\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) or the presence (\\(n=12\\)-\\(18\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) of AAV:hPKP2 transgene. Quantified data were presented as mean \\(\\pm 8\\). Statistical significance was evaluated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test).

Call contractility was recorded from day 3 to 8 post AAV transduction and analyzed by Pulse video analysis (Curi Bio). Average nuclear counts from live cells were used to normalize contraction velocity. Quantified data were presented as mean \\(\\pm 8\\). Statistical significance was evaluated by ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test). \\(P\\) value: \\(\\%p<0.05\\), \\(\\%p<0.01\\), \\(\\%n*p<0.001\\), \\(\\%n*p<0.0001\\).\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe have presented these changes in response to TN-401 (Fig. 7e, genes of interest marked in red). Intriguingly, RNA sequencing analysis at the transcriptional level showed a positive dose correlation to TN-401 among structural genes encoding desmosomes, Cx43, sarcomeres, ion channels and Ca\\({}^{1+}\\) handling proteins (Fig. 7f). When examining expression of heart failure markers and fibrosis genes, we noticed a negative dose correlation to TN-401 (Fig. 7f). Therefore, while key functional readouts of efficacy could not be distinguished between dose levels of 3E13 and 6E13 g/kg, the 2-fold difference in PKP2 transcript levels achieved by these two doses did result in quantitative and dose-dependent changes in transcriptional signatures described above. Based on this observation, we believe that identification of key genes can be informative in associating a transcriptional signature with a particular phase of ARVC disease progression and therefore, may facilitate patient stratification in a more quantitative and precise manner, particularly in early 'concealed' phase when structural changes are not evident.\n\nTranscriptome analyses showed that TN-401 restored expression of structural genes and attenuated expression of genes encoding adverse remodeling factors in a highly coordinated and quantitative fashion. We asked whether such transcriptional response can be sustained to attenuate disease progression and therefore, extend survival over a longer duration.\n\nAs shown earlier in Fig. 6, a single dose of AAV9-mPrkp2 treatment at 1E14 q/kg after overt cardiomyopathy batlied disease progression via reversed adverse right ventricular remodeling, improved LV function, a trending reduction in arrhythmias, and extended median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 50 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion. Heart tissues collected at 51 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion were analyzed by RNA sequencing (Fig. 8a). Compared to intervention before overt structural changes (the preventive mode, animals dosed at 1E13, 3E13 or 1E14 q/kg), AAV9:mPrkp2 intervention after overt structural change (the therapeutic mode, animals dosed at 1E14 q/kg) showed comparable efficacy in extending life span at the same dose, 1E14 q/kg (Fig. 8b). PCA\\({}^{3}\\) showed that transcriptional profiles of AAV9:mPrkp2-treated _Pbz_2-_CRO_ animals were clustered close to WT and distant from vehicle-treated animals, suggesting a normalization of transcriptional landscape close to WT in response to the treatment (Fig. 8c). While the transcriptional profile of low-dose treated animals showed a partial recovery pattern, the transcriptional profiles of the high-dose treated animals effectively overlapped with that of WT samples (Fig. 8c). In addition, when comparing\n\nFig. 4: **An early and single dose of AAV9-PKP2 significantly reduced arrhythmias, improved cardiac function, and prolonged median lifespan to 2 58 weeks post AAV administration.** A study design to evaluate TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 efficacy using _Pbz_2-_CRO_ ARVC mouse model. AAV9 was injected three weeks before gene deletion, TN-401 at 3E13 vector genomes per kilogram bodyweight (yg/kg) and AAV9:mPrkp2 at 5E13 q/kg, Echocardiograph (Echo) and electrocardiogram (EEG) data were collected at week 3 and week 4 post gene deletion. B raw PKC traces showed a significant contrast in spontaneous arrhythmias in _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice in the absence and the presence of TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment. PVCs, premature ventricular contractions, NSVT, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The right graph summarized arrhythmia scores representing frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias. This arrhythmia score is an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia done (see Supplementary Table 1). Statistical significance in response to TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment was evaluated using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction. c TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment of _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice showed efficacy in reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight (mm\\({}^{2}\\)/g) and (**d**) maintaining left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 weeks post gene deletion. Time course of RV dilation was evaluated with ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tablev\u2019s post-hoc test), statistical significance shown between the vehicle treated cKO animals and TN-401 treated cKO animals. EPUs was evaluated with ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tablev\u2019s post-hoc test). **Equal**:Meier survival curve showed that TN-401 extended median lifespan of _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice by \\(\\geq\\)58 weeks post gene deletion. Numbers in paratheses showed dead vs live animals by the time of takedown. Animals treated by AAV9:mPrkp2 (in green line) were taken down early for exploratory studies. Quantified data were presented as mean x.s.m. Sample size \\(n=9\\), 10, 11, 10 for WT, cKO, cKO+TN-401, and cKO+ AAV9:mPrkp2, respectively.\n\n the total number of differentially up- or down-regulated genes relative to the WT animals, the preventive mode and to a lesser degree, the therapeutic mode of intervention showed a significant normalization compared to that between _Pkp2-kCO_ and WT animals (Fig. 8d). When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant negatively enriched gene sets identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[4] were mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac muscle contraction, and cardiac muscle conduction. The top significant positively enriched gene sets were predominantly fibrosis related. Both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the\n\nFig. 5: 1 TN-401 **dose-dependently reduced arrhythmias, improved heart structure and cardiac function, restored expression of desmosome proteins and Ctx3 and prevented development of fibrosis in _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse. a Study design to evaluate dose-dependent efficacy of TN-401 using _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse model. Mice were injected with TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, or 1E14 wygfa or one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion. At 4 weeks post tamoxifen induction (3 weeks post TN-401 injection), animals were sacrificed for expression and histological evaluation. b TN-401 showed dose-dependent efficacy at 3 weeks in preventing decline of % LV ejection fraction, preventing RV dilation (mm/\\(\\beta\\)), and a trending improvement in arrhythmia scores. Statistical significance of EPPs and RV dilation in response to TN-401 treatment was evaluated with ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test) and arrhythmia scores with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction. c Semi-quantifative Western had analyses showed restoration of PKP2, JUP, and DSP protein at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA. d Immunohistochemistry for the given motion protein, connexin 43 (Cxt3), in heart tissue sections showed restoration of Cxt3 expression at the total number of differentially up- or down-regulated genes relative to the WT animals, the preventive mode and to a lesser degree, the therapeutic mode of intervention showed a significant normalization compared to that between _Pkp2-kCO_ and WT animals (Fig. 8d). When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant increased discs (DD) at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment (the top panels, 50 \u03bcm). Red arrows indicate DD. Trichrome staining showed a significant reduction of fibrosis, muscle (red) and fibrosis (blue), in heart sections at 3 weeks post AAV treatment (the bottom panels, 2 \u03bcm). Yellow arrows highlight areas with fibrosis in _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse heart. The percentage of collagen-positive tissue was quantified and shown in the right graph. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test), e RT-qPCR analyses of RV tissue at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment showed expression of _hPKP2_ transgene and suppression of heart failure markers (_Npo1_) (_Npo2_) (_Npp4_ did not show statistical significance) and fibrosis genes (_Collal_, _Colal_, _Timp1_).

To our surprise, the long-term survival benefit offered by either mode of intervention was supported by a broad spectrum of sustained correction of gene expression encoding components of the desmosomes, sarcomerey, ion channels and calcium handling systems, along with multiple pathways that regulate metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis as shown (Fig. 8f, g). Once again, both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the preventive mode effect being most complete (Fig. 8g). Quantitative RT-PCR validated that at the same dose, 1E14 vg/kg, each mode of intervention maintained a similar level of _Pkp2_ transgene expression at 51 weeks, suggesting the mode of intervention does not change the durability of the transgene expression (Fig. 8h). Expression of fibrosis genes (_Timp1_, _Colla1_, and _Col3a1_) were significantly lowered by both modes of treatments at 1E14 yg/kg except for _Col3a1_ in left ventricle in response to the therapeutic mode of treatment. Expression of heart failure genes (_Nppa_ and _Nppb_) showed trending responses to the preventive mode of treatment relative to the untreated cKO animals (Fig. 8h). In agreement with the observation shown by RNA-seq analyses, fibrosis or heart failure genes were reduced to a lesser extent in therapeutic mode than in the preventive mode among age-matched animals (Fig. 8f, g the top panel).\n\nWe concluded that long-term restoration of PKP2 expression by gene replacement approach was correlated with sustained restoration of a broad spectrum of structural genes and pathways, supporting a notion that early intervention is the key to restoring PKP2-associated intrinsic transcriptional networks and their functions and therefore, increasing overall cardiomyocyte fitness to effectively mitigate adverse maladaptive remodeling such as fibrosis as early as possible. These results strongly support that PKP2-associated transcriptional networks can be used to quantitatively evaluate the extent of disease progression and gene therapy efficacy at the molecular level.\n\n### More than 10x an efficacious dose of TN-401 proved to be tolerated in WT CD1 mice.\n\nA six-week pilot tolerability study of TN-401 via intravenous injection at 1E14 or 3E14 yg/kg in WT CD1 mice (Fig. 9a) showed no adverse effects at \\(\\pm\\)10x an efficacious dose on body weight (Fig. 9b), heart weight and ventricular functions (Fig. 9c), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (Fig. 9d), liver weight and enzyme levels (Fig. 9e), and platelet count and hemoglobin levels (Fig. 9f). Histological analyses showed no TN-401-related changes in heart, lung, liver, pancreas, brain, kidneys, and skeletal muscle examined. Pivotal IND enabling toxicology studies conducted by Tenaya Therapeutics demonstrated safety of TN-401 in both mice and non-human primates. Due to the focus of this report, these data are not included, but were contained in the TN-401 IND application, which has received clearance from the FDA.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur preclinical results demonstrated that AAV9-based PKP2 gene replacement approach can offer significant survival benefit in repairing cellular structures of desmosome, GJs, and Ca\\({}^{3+}\\)-handling system, improving cardiac function, reducing PVC frequency and occurrences of NSVT, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling in a cardiac-specific _Pkp2_ knock-out mouse model of ARVC.\n\nAbout 50% of ARVC patients carry a genetic mutation in desmosome genes and approximately 40% of this patient population carries mutations in _PKP2_. The heterogeneity of clinical symptoms of ARVC indicates genetic composition, maladaptive remodeling, environmental factors, lifestyle, and other unknown factors of individuals likely affect disease onset and progression. Although mutations in desmosome genes have been confirmed as an underlying genetic cause of ARVC by large-scale prevalence studies [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], current understanding of the genetic background of this disease is limited and compounded by non-genetic factors and missing molecular links between defective desmosomes and disease development. Using both iPSC-CM and cardiac-specific _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse models of ARVC and AAV9-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression, this study demonstrates that PKP2 is the essential genetic determinant underpinning (1) intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes; (2) disease onset based on the preventive mode of efficacy studies, which proved AAV9.PKP2 effect to be dose-dependent with significant prevention of multiple disease phenotypes (Figs. 4, 5, 7, and 8); (3) disease progression based on the therapeutic mode of efficacy study, which showed reversal of right ventricle enlargement, halted decline of left ventricle function, a trending reduction in PVC frequency and NSVT occurrence, and most importantly, reduction of mortality (Figs. 6 and 8). As shown in our data, our therapies ameliorated arrhythmia severity by decreasing the PVC burden and the occurrence of NSVT. PVC and NSVT can trigger the differentiating arrhythmias and are associated with increased risk for SCD [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 restoration of PKP2 leads to a highly coordinated and durable restoration of structural genes encoding desmosome, sarcomere, and Ca\\({}^{2+}\\)-handling system components, supporting the desmosome as a fundamental molecular regulatory hub in maintaining cellular integrity and function of cardiomyocytes and the heart, overall (Figs. 7 and 8).\n\nThese data further support that an early intervention by gene therapy before overt structural change could project a better prognostic outcome by fixing desmosome-related structural and functional deficits to maintain the overall fitness of cardiomyocytes and to prevent irreversible changes that could compromise the efficacy of gene therapy (Figs. 6 and 8). If overt structural changes have occurred, gene therapy is not expected to be effective, for example, in removing fibrosis or in replenishing more cardiomyocytesytes. These irreversible changes were investigated in our studies as both preventive and therapeutic modes of intervention showed significant reduction of enriched fibrosis gene sets. However, reduction of fibrosis by the therapeutic mode was to a lesser extent with a concomitant trending higher expression of heart failure genes, _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ (Fig. 8f, g the top panel and Fig. 8h). The trending higher expression of _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ in the therapeutic mode of intervention might support observations that the natriuretic peptides encoded by _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ were functionally implicated in cardiac antifibrotic effects [60]. Significantly, both modes of intervention showed comparable survival benefit, dramatically extending lifespan.\n\nTranscriptome analyses of long-term effects of gene replacement in the therapeutic mode did not have a corresponding age-matched control, which would be the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-cKO_ animals that had survived to 51 weeks (Fig. 8). It would be informative to understand the extent of secondary maladaptive remodeling that occurred after overt cardiomyopathy-pathy at the age of 51 weeks as the baseline for our therapeutic mode of intervention. This would allow us to determine whether the secondary maladaptive effects responded to the long-term treatment or to evaluate disease regression with pre-existing overt structural changes.\n\nCardiomyocytes lose due to atrophy or apoptosis puts unique challenges on what might or might not be responsive to therapeutic interventions in adult heart tissue. However, it is intriguing to see proposed reversibility of secondary maladaptive remodeling due to an overall long-term improvement of cardiac performance [61]. The long-term effects by gene replacement targeting cardiomyopathy remain unknown in terms of its potential for disease reversibility. Surprisingly, in our studies, long-term AAV9-PKP2 treatment after overt RV dilatation showed an increased expression of genes underlying sarcomere organization (Fig. 8g, the middle panel with Preventive/WT and Therapeutic/WT). This transcriptional signature could suggest a mechanism of partial regression of adverse structural remodeling due to enhanced sarcomere function in surviving cardiomyocytes. We are currently investigating this possibility.\n\nThere are several limitations inherent to this study. First, the majority of PKP2 mutations in human patients are heterozygous germline mutations. The presentation of disease phenotypes in PKP2-mutated ARVC patients progresses gradually with time as discussed in the introduction. In contrast, our proof-of-concept model is a cardiac-specific conditional knock-out model of _Pkp2_ with severe phenotypes that develop in a short period of time after gene deletion. Therefore, the robust phenotypes presented in this mouse model could possibly have different sensitivities to gene therapy relative to the more slowly developing phenotypes associated with human disease. Since all proof-of concept studies were conducted in mouse models, an important caveat is that the clinical efficacy of TN-401 and other PKP2 gene therapy programs or proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64] (https://rocketpharma.com/aav-presentations-and-posters/; https://www.lexeotax.com/post/lexeo-therapeutics-announces-data-presentations-at-the-26th-american-society-of-gene-cell-therapy-asgct-annual-meeting/) remain to be evaluated in patients with ARVC caused by PKP2 mutations. Second, our study designs and data interpretation were focused on how cardiac function, arrhythmia, and animal survival responded to the gene therapy and on determination of the PKP2 dose-function relationship. We are unable to use this model to evaluate germline impact on organ development and compensatory mechanisms in the presence of PKP2 mutations. Third, although amelioration of arrhythmias in response to the gene therapy was confirmed by EKG and supported by large-scale RNA sequencing analysis on restored gene expression of Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling system, we do not have direct evidence to support a functional restoration of Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling at the cellular level. We are currently investigating Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling using isolated primary cardiomyocytes from heart tissue in response to the gene therapy.\n\nIn the studies we present, _Pkp2-cKO_ animals treated with the formulation buffer served as the vehicle control to the animals treated with TN-401 or AAV9-mPh2. Although buffer vehicles, empty capsids or AAV expressing GFP served as controls in other gene therapy proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, \n\n## Conclusions\n\nUsing a cardiac KO mouse model of ARVC, we identified fundamental mechanisms behind disruption of PKP2-associated desmosome function and revealed its broad impact at the transcriptional level on Gjs, sarcomere, ion channels and Ca\\({}^{2+}\\) handling systems, and multiple pathways that critically regulate metabolism, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. These studies highlight the importance of identifying key transcripts in characterizing ARVC disease state and disease progression in a more quantitative and precise manner. Our efficacy data with PKP2 gene therapy and mechanistic analyses shed more light on understanding ARVC etiology andin practice, may help patients and physicians to make decisions regarding disease management and treatment.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this article as Source data. Source data for Figs. 1-9 and Supplementary Figs. 5-6 can be found in Supplementary Data 1. The list of mouse age and gender and sequences for RT-qPCR are available in Supplementary Data 1. RNA sequencing datasets are available at GSE253226. All other data are available from the corresponding author (or other sources, as applicable) on reasonable request. Queries related to arrhythmias should be addressed to compare preventive vs _Pkp2-xKO_, therapeutic vs WT, and preventive vs therapeutic. If Relative gene expression of selected genes was measured by RNA-seq. Samples were sorted by treatment groups and RV and LV chambers. Genes were categorized by gene classes. Each column depicted a scaled average across samples of each treatment group.

Currently, there are no approved treatments that address the underlying genetic cause of this disease, representing a significant unmet need. Mutations in _Plakophilin-2 (PKP2)_, encoding a desmosomal protein, account for approximately 40% of ARVC cases and result in reduced gene expression.\n\n**Methods** Our goal is to examine the feasibility and the efficacy of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression in a cardiac specific knock-out mouse model of _Pkp2_.\n\n**Results** We show that a single dose of AAV9:PKP2 gene delivery prevents disease development before the onset of cardiomyopathy and attenuates disease progression after overt cardiomyopathy. Restoration of PKP2 expression leads to a significant extension of lifespan by restoring cellular structures of desmosomes and gap junctions, preventing or halting decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, preventing or reversing dilation of the right ventricle, ameliorating ventricular arrhythmia event frequency and severity, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling. RNA sequencing analyses show that restoration of _PKP2_ expression leads to highly coordinated and durable correction of _PKP2_-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes, revealing a broad spectrum of biological perturbances behind ARVC disease etiology.\n\n**Conclusions** We identify fundamental mechanisms of PKP2-associated ARVC beyond disruption of desmosome function. The observed PKP2 dose-function relationship indicates that cardiac-selective AAV9:PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising therapeutic approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction1, Clinical presentation of ARVC progresses from a concealed early phase, a later manifestation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and ultimately heart failure that requires heart transplant1, ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1:1000 to 1:5000 with the mean age of presentation before 40 years old2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nFootnote 1: email: agreer-short@tenayathera.com; jane.yang@tenayathera.com\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart disease characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive cardiac dysfunction1, Clinical presentation of ARVC progress from a concealed early phase, a later manifestation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and ultimately heart failure that requires heart transplant1, ARVC has an estimated prevalence in the general population of 1:1000 to 1:5000 with the mean age of presentation before 40 years old2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.\n\nFootnote 1: email: agreer-short@tenayathera.com; jane.yang@tenayathera.com\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a heart disease that leads to abnormal heartbeats and a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. ARVC is often caused by changes in a gene called _PKP2_, that then makes less PKP2 protein. PKP2 protein is important for the normal structure and function of the heart. Human ARVC characteristics can be mimicked in a mouse model missing this gene. Given no therapeutic option, our goal was to test if adding a working copy of _PKP2_ gene in the heart of this mouse model, using a technique called gene therapy that can deliver genes to cells, could improve heart function.

Restoration of PKP2 expression leads to a significant extension of lifespan by restoring cellular structures of desmosomes and gap junctions, preventing or halting decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, preventing or reversing dilation of the right ventricle, ameliorating ventricular arrhythmia event frequency and severity, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling. RNA sequencing analyses show that restoration of _PKP2_ expression leads to highly coordinated and durable correction of _PKP2_-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes, revealing a broad spectrum of biological perturbances behind ARVC disease etiology.\n\n**Conclusions** We identify fundamental mechanisms of PKP2-associated ARVC beyond disruption of desmosome function.

The normalized enrichment score, which reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented in the ranked list and normalized for gene set size, was used to select significantly altered gene sets. Trends in normalized enrichment scores for some gene sets of interest were shown in heatmaps, which were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### ", "AAV:PKP2 corrected disease phenotypes in a human iPSC-CM model": "\n\nTo model ARVC disease and identify the molecular, structural, and functional signatures that are fundamental to the disease mechanisms, we carried out RNA sequencing analyses of iPSC-CMs after acute silencing of _PKP2_ expression. These studies revealed that the desmosome functions as a signaling hub connecting key structures\\({}^{\\alpha}\\) in cardiomyocytes such that reduction in _PKP2_ expression led to down-regulation of structural and functional gene expression encoding components of desmosomes, sarcomere, intermediate filaments, and ion channels (Fig. 1a). Down-regulation of protein was shown for desmoplkin (DSP), plakoglobin (UDP), myosin-binding protein C3 (MyBPC3), and desmin (DES) (Fig. 1b, the left panel and Supplementary Fig. 1). Trending down-regulation of mRNA was shown for sodium voltage-gated channel a subunit 5 (_SCNSA_) (Fig. 1b, the right panel). PKP2 deficiency resulted in structural disappearance of PKP2 and DSP from the cellular membrane and caused cell disarray of patterned iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1c). In addition, PKP2 deficiency perturbed both contractile (Fig. 1d) and electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1e).\n\nThe 1st generation expression cassette was used for iPSC-CM-based studies and the 2nd generation for in vivo mouse efficacy studies (Fig. 2a). Dose-dependent protein expression was evident in iPSC-CMs driven by a cardiac-specific troponin T promoter (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). AAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CRS9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), restored DSP expression post _PKP2_ silencing when compared to the reduced DSP protein without AAV rescue (Fig. 2c, d). AAV:hPKP2 restored contractility as quantified by contraction velocity when compared to the reduced contraction velocity without AAV rescue (Fig. 2e). Using human iPSC-CMs as a cell model for ARVC, AAV:hPKP2 restored desmosomes and rescued contractility in PKP2-deficient iPSC-CMs, suggesting PKP2 governs intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes.\n\n### ", "Pkp2-cKO ARVC mouse model recapitulated the majority of human ARVC clinical manifestations": "\n\nWe used a mouse conditional knockout model to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of AAV9-mediated _PKP2_ gene replacement. Consistent with the early observations of this model\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), tamoxifen-induced cardiac deletion of both alleles of _Pkp2_ in adult mice did not show over structural and functional changes at 1 week post induction. Tissue collection at the end of the study and weekly monitoring showed disruption of desmosomes and GJs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3), high burden of spontaneous premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Fig. 3b) and occurrences of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (Supplementary Fig. 4), biventricular dilatation (Fig. 3d), and a sharp decline in cardiac function (Fig. 3c) and survival (Fig. 3e) after 3-4 weeks of induced cardiac knock-out of _Pkp2_. These phenotypes recapitulated human ARVC clinical manifestations. However, unlike in humans, heterozygous disruption of _Pkp2_ in mouse hearts did not result in cardiac phenotypes that closely recapitulated human ARVC symptoms [5, 6]. Thus, homozygous _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse was used as a model of human ARVC.\n\n \n\n**TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment largely attenuated disease development and disease progression to mortality in Pkp2-ekO ARVC mouse.** To determine whether the AAV9 expression cassette (Fig. 2a, the 2nd generation) encoding either the human _PKP2_ or the mouse ortholog could counteract the effects of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion, _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given a single systematic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 (AAV9: human PKP2 at 3E13 vg/kg) or AAV9:mPkp2 (AAV9: mouse Pkp2 at 5E13 vg/kg) 3 weeks prior to tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 4a). A lower dose level of the human ortholog was selected to limit the risk of over-expressing the human protein in this mouse model. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was used as the carrier buffer for TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 to prevent aggregation of capsids. It was administered as the vehicle control to WT and to _Pkp2-ekO_ animals. There were 4 experimental groups: 'WT' and 'ekO' were treated with the vehicle and _Pkp2-ekO_ animals treated with either 'TN-401' or 'AAV9:mPkp2' as shown in Fig. 4.\n\nAt 4 weeks post gene deletion and 7 weeks post AAV treatment, human or mouse PKP2 inhibited the development of frequent PVCs and the occurrence of NSVT as summarized by a ventricular arrhythmia score (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Table 1 used as an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia burden), prevented right ventricular remodeling (Fig. 4c), and prevented decline in left ventricular function (Fig. 4d). Frequent PVCs, RV and LV remodeling, and LV function decline were prominent features of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 4 weeks post gene deletion. TN-401 demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing ARVC development and in extending median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 58 weeks, far beyond the 4.7 weeks observed in the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-ekO_ animals (Fig. 4e). In this same study, we also evaluated efficacy of AAV9:mPkp2 in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 3 intervention timepoints and concluded that treatments at 3 weeks before, right after, or 1 week after gene deletion yielded comparable efficacy in EP%, RV remodeling, arrhythmias, and prolonged lifespan of more than 50% of the treated animals by 50 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, these results showed that either the human PKP2 or the ortholog was sufficient to prevent the detrimental cardiac and survival phenotypes of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice when delivered in the AAV9 vector. In addition, we were unable to detect sex difference in either _Pkp2-ekO_ mice or treatment groups (information on sex distribution in each study is detailed in Supplementary Data 1).\n\nTo assess the dose response to TN-401 (Fig. 5) or AAV9:mPkp2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given single systemic treatments via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, and 1E14 vg/kg one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 5a). All animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks post induction (3 weeks post AAV treatment) for histological and expression analyses. TN-401 treatment of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice showed dose-dependent efficacy in preventing decline of LV ejection fraction, reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight, and a trending reduction in arrhythmias (Fig. 5b). This dose-dependent efficacy was confirmed with larger cohorts of animals in significantly improving LV ejection fraction, reducing RV area and arrhythmia burden, and improving survival (Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nAt molecular level, left ventricle heart tissue showed dose-dependent protein expression of human PKP2 (Fig. 5c, the top panel; Western blot images in Supplementary Fig. 7) as well as corresponding restoration of DSP and JUP, two additional desmosome proteins that were decreased in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice (Fig. 5c, the bottom two panels). Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein present at intercalated discs, was reduced in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry of heart tissue, and was restored in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice treated with TN-401 (Fig. 5d, the top row). TN-401 treatment also significantly reduced fibrosis development and collagen deposition in both right ventricle and left ventricle (Fig. 5d, the bottom row) and quantification shown in the right graph). In addition, quantitative analyses of molecular signatures supported that TN-401 treatment reduced mRNA expression of heart failure markers (a significant _Npp_ reduction and a trending _Npp_ reduction), fibrosis, and tissue remodeling genes in the right ventricles (only human PKP2 transgene expression was quantified) (Fig. 5e).\n\nOverall, TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment supported a dose-dependent efficacy in improving ARVC phenotypes in _Pkp2-ekO_ mouse model of ARVC. TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 in the dose-escalation studies demonstrated efficacy at doses \\(\\geq\\)3E13 vg/kg in preventing adverse right ventricular remodeling, and improving ventricular function, fibrosis, and electrophysiological properties.\n\nThe preventive mode of treatment, dosing before overt structural changes, demonstrated significant benefit of early intervention in largely preventing disease development and extending lifespan. To further examine whether ARVC disease progression could be slowed down or attenuated by restoration of PKP2 expression after overt structural changes, the therapeutic mode of treatment, we dos animals via retro-orbital injection of AAV9:mPkp2 at 1E14 vg/kg at 2.5 weeks after cardiac deletion of _Pkp2_ (Fig. 6a). At 2.5 weeks, overt structural changes were observed that coincided with a rapid development of RV dilation, LVEF decline, and significant ventricular arrhythmias (Fig. 3). Note that the rapid mortality presented by this mouse model (within 3-6 weeks of tamoxifen induction) combined with the relatively slow time course of AAV9 transduction and transgene expression make it challenging to perform the therapeutic mode of treatment. However, at 9 weeks post induction, AAV9:mPkp2 prevented further decline of the left ventricle function when compared to the treated animals at 4 weeks (\\(p=0.9416\\), ns) (Fig. 6c, f), reduced and reversed right ventricle enlargement when compared to the WT level (\\(p=0.6856\\), ns) (Fig. 6d, g). Arrhythmia scores showed a trending, but not statistically significant reduction (Fig. 6e, h). This therapeutic mode of treatment reduced mortality throughout one year follow-up with a median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\)50 weeks (Fig. 6b), which is comparable to the survival benefit observed in the preventive mode of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6e).\n\n**Restoration of PKP2 expression led to a highly coordinated and durable correction of PKP2-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes.** It was rather surprising to observe that restoration of a single desmosome component, PKP2, led to significant survival benefits, improved cardiac function, reversed adverse RV remodeling, reduced ventricular arrhythmia frequency and severity, and\n\nFig. 1: **siRNA-mediated acute PKP2 silencing impacted both cellular structure and functions of human IPSC-CMs.** **a** Heatmap of RNA sequencing analyses from IPSC-CMs (\\(n=1\\) for negative control, sixNeg, and \\(n=3\\) biological replicates for siRNAs against PKP2, sIFKP2) harvested only day 2, 4,6, and 8, respectively, after siRNA treatment, highlighting effects on genes encoding components of the desmosome, sarcomere, and alcohol channels.**b** PKP2 silencing led to reduction in protein expression of DSP, JUP, DES, and MyBPC3 in response to reduced PKP2 protein (Western blot on the left panel, day 8, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and a trending reduction in SCNS mRNA in response to reduced PKP2 mRNA (RNA sequencing reads from Fig. 1a), ePKP2 silencing resulted in disappearance of PKP2 and DSP protein from the cellular membrane (top two rows, day 10, \\(n=5\\) technical replicates; IXM confocal microscope; 25 \\(\\mu\\)m) and cell disarray in patterned iPSC-CMs (bottom row).\n\nprevented fibrosis. We asked whether \"on-target\" PKP2 effects possibly extend beyond its effects on the desmosome by evaluating PKP2 dose-dependent response, specifically at the transcriptional level. To our knowledge, there has been no reported study that reveals whether (1) PKP2 dynamically coordinates its gene expression with other desmosome members, and (2) to what extent PKP2 quantitively dictates the state of disease progression. To obtain a deeper understanding, two large-scale RNA sequencing analyses were conducted.\n\n_Pkp2-cKO_ mice were given a single systemic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 3E13 or 6E13 vg/kg one week before tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 7a) and cardiac function and arrhythmias were evaluated at 4 and 9 weeks post induction. Mice were sacrificed at 9 weeks post induction and heart tissues were collected for RNA sequencing and quantification of PKP2 RNA and protein expression. At a 2-fold expression difference between 3E13 ygkg and 6E13 ygkg doses at 9 weeks (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 8), we did not observe significant dose-dependent difference in key readouts of EF %, LV mass, RV dilatation, and arrhythmia score, although one out of six PKP2 silencing and day 8 of AAV transduction, the left bar graph summarized the percentage of cells without GFP (\\(n=12\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and with GFP (\\(n=24\\)-\\(36\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates). The right graph showed restored DSP protein expression quantified by total intensity of immunofluorescence signal for Pkp2 silencing in the absence (\\(n=6\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) or the presence (\\(n=12\\)-\\(18\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) of AAV:hPKP2 transgene.

Intriguingly, RNA sequencing analysis at the transcriptional level showed a positive dose correlation to TN-401 among structural genes encoding desmosomes, Cx43, sarcomeres, ion channels and Ca\\({}^{1+}\\) handling proteins (Fig. 7f). When examining expression of heart failure markers and fibrosis genes, we noticed a negative dose correlation to TN-401 (Fig. 7f). Therefore, while key functional readouts of efficacy could not be distinguished between dose levels of 3E13 and 6E13 g/kg, the 2-fold difference in PKP2 transcript levels achieved by these two doses did result in quantitative and dose-dependent changes in transcriptional signatures described above. Based on this observation, we believe that identification of key genes can be informative in associating a transcriptional signature with a particular phase of ARVC disease progression and therefore, may facilitate patient stratification in a more quantitative and precise manner, particularly in early 'concealed' phase when structural changes are not evident.\n\nTranscriptome analyses showed that TN-401 restored expression of structural genes and attenuated expression of genes encoding adverse remodeling factors in a highly coordinated and quantitative fashion. We asked whether such transcriptional response can be sustained to attenuate disease progression and therefore, extend survival over a longer duration.\n\nAs shown earlier in Fig. 6, a single dose of AAV9-mPrkp2 treatment at 1E14 q/kg after overt cardiomyopathy batlied disease progression via reversed adverse right ventricular remodeling, improved LV function, a trending reduction in arrhythmias, and extended median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 50 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion. Heart tissues collected at 51 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion were analyzed by RNA sequencing (Fig. 8a). Compared to intervention before overt structural changes (the preventive mode, animals dosed at 1E13, 3E13 or 1E14 q/kg), AAV9:mPrkp2 intervention after overt structural change (the therapeutic mode, animals dosed at 1E14 q/kg) showed comparable efficacy in extending life span at the same dose, 1E14 q/kg (Fig. 8b). PCA\\({}^{3}\\) showed that transcriptional profiles of AAV9:mPrkp2-treated _Pbz_2-_CRO_ animals were clustered close to WT and distant from vehicle-treated animals, suggesting a normalization of transcriptional landscape close to WT in response to the treatment (Fig. 8c). While the transcriptional profile of low-dose treated animals showed a partial recovery pattern, the transcriptional profiles of the high-dose treated animals effectively overlapped with that of WT samples (Fig. 8c). In addition, when comparing\n\nFig. 4: **An early and single dose of AAV9-PKP2 significantly reduced arrhythmias, improved cardiac function, and prolonged median lifespan to 2 58 weeks post AAV administration.** A study design to evaluate TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 efficacy using _Pbz_2-_CRO_ ARVC mouse model. AAV9 was injected three weeks before gene deletion, TN-401 at 3E13 vector genomes per kilogram bodyweight (yg/kg) and AAV9:mPrkp2 at 5E13 q/kg, Echocardiograph (Echo) and electrocardiogram (EEG) data were collected at week 3 and week 4 post gene deletion. B raw PKC traces showed a significant contrast in spontaneous arrhythmias in _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice in the absence and the presence of TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment. PVCs, premature ventricular contractions, NSVT, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The right graph summarized arrhythmia scores representing frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias. This arrhythmia score is an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia done (see Supplementary Table 1).

When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant negatively enriched gene sets identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[4] were mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac muscle contraction, and cardiac muscle conduction. The top significant positively enriched gene sets were predominantly fibrosis related. Both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the\n\nFig. 5: 1 TN-401 **dose-dependently reduced arrhythmias, improved heart structure and cardiac function, restored expression of desmosome proteins and Ctx3 and prevented development of fibrosis in _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse. a Study design to evaluate dose-dependent efficacy of TN-401 using _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse model. Mice were injected with TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, or 1E14 wygfa or one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion.

Statistical significance of EPPs and RV dilation in response to TN-401 treatment was evaluated with ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test) and arrhythmia scores with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction. c Semi-quantifative Western had analyses showed restoration of PKP2, JUP, and DSP protein at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA. d Immunohistochemistry for the given motion protein, connexin 43 (Cxt3), in heart tissue sections showed restoration of Cxt3 expression at the total number of differentially up- or down-regulated genes relative to the WT animals, the preventive mode and to a lesser degree, the therapeutic mode of intervention showed a significant normalization compared to that between _Pkp2-kCO_ and WT animals (Fig. 8d). When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant increased discs (DD) at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment (the top panels, 50 \u03bcm). Red arrows indicate DD. Trichrome staining showed a significant reduction of fibrosis, muscle (red) and fibrosis (blue), in heart sections at 3 weeks post AAV treatment (the bottom panels, 2 \u03bcm).

Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test), e RT-qPCR analyses of RV tissue at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment showed expression of _hPKP2_ transgene and suppression of heart failure markers (_Npo1_) (_Npo2_) (_Npp4_ did not show statistical significance) and fibrosis genes (_Collal_, _Colal_, _Timp1_).

To our surprise, the long-term survival benefit offered by either mode of intervention was supported by a broad spectrum of sustained correction of gene expression encoding components of the desmosomes, sarcomerey, ion channels and calcium handling systems, along with multiple pathways that regulate metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis as shown (Fig. 8f, g). Once again, both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the preventive mode effect being most complete (Fig. 8g). Quantitative RT-PCR validated that at the same dose, 1E14 vg/kg, each mode of intervention maintained a similar level of _Pkp2_ transgene expression at 51 weeks, suggesting the mode of intervention does not change the durability of the transgene expression (Fig. 8h). Expression of fibrosis genes (_Timp1_, _Colla1_, and _Col3a1_) were significantly lowered by both modes of treatments at 1E14 yg/kg except for _Col3a1_ in left ventricle in response to the therapeutic mode of treatment. Expression of heart failure genes (_Nppa_ and _Nppb_) showed trending responses to the preventive mode of treatment relative to the untreated cKO animals (Fig. 8h). In agreement with the observation shown by RNA-seq analyses, fibrosis or heart failure genes were reduced to a lesser extent in therapeutic mode than in the preventive mode among age-matched animals (Fig. 8f, g the top panel).\n\nWe concluded that long-term restoration of PKP2 expression by gene replacement approach was correlated with sustained restoration of a broad spectrum of structural genes and pathways, supporting a notion that early intervention is the key to restoring PKP2-associated intrinsic transcriptional networks and their functions and therefore, increasing overall cardiomyocyte fitness to effectively mitigate adverse maladaptive remodeling such as fibrosis as early as possible. These results strongly support that PKP2-associated transcriptional networks can be used to quantitatively evaluate the extent of disease progression and gene therapy efficacy at the molecular level.\n\n### ", "More than 10x an efficacious dose of TN-401 proved to be tolerated in WT CD1 mice.": "\n\nA six-week pilot tolerability study of TN-401 via intravenous injection at 1E14 or 3E14 yg/kg in WT CD1 mice (Fig. 9a) showed no adverse effects at \\(\\pm\\)10x an efficacious dose on body weight (Fig. 9b), heart weight and ventricular functions (Fig. 9c), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (Fig. 9d), liver weight and enzyme levels (Fig. 9e), and platelet count and hemoglobin levels (Fig. 9f).

ARVC is often caused by changes in a gene called _PKP2_, that then makes less PKP2 protein. PKP2 protein is important for the normal structure and function of the heart. Human ARVC characteristics can be mimicked in a mouse model missing this gene. Given no therapeutic option, our goal was to test if adding a working copy of _PKP2_ gene in the heart of this mouse model, using a technique called gene therapy that can deliver genes to cells, could improve heart function. Here, we show that a single dose of PKP2 gene therapy can improve heart function and heartbeats as well as extend lifespan in mice. PKP2 gene therapy may be a promising approach to treat ARVC patients with _PKP2_ mutations.\n\n organization of intermediate filaments, cardiac sarcomere, and other organelles [31, 32]. Mutations in the _PKP2_ gene are most commonly heterozygous in patients and lead to haploinsufficiency in PKP2 mRNA and protein [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, cated plates at a density of 20,000 cells per well of 96-well plates or at a seeding density proportional to the well size.

Two days after transfection, medium was removed and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. Cells were fixed at above time points to determine the effectiveness of silencing using antibody staining and immunofluorescence microscopy. Silencer Select Negative Control siRNA and siRNA #3 or #4 against _PKP2_ were applied to iPSC-CMs seeded on three 4Dcell 35 mm dishes on day 7 and fixed on day 10 post silencing for immunofluorescence.\n\nAAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CR9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\\({}^{\\underline{c}}\\). This AAV9 variant-based rescue was carried out by AAV transduction at different MOI, multiplicity of infection, on the 3rd day post siRNA-mediated silencing. After overnight transduction of AAV, media was removed the next morning and replaced with fresh CDI maintenance media. TN-401 expression cassette is composed of a codon optimized human PKP2. The codon optimization renders the coding sequence resistant to siRNA-mediated silencing.\n\n### Evaluation of contractility and electrical signals of iPSC-CMs\n\nContraction of iPSC-CMs was recorded in bright field by SONY SI8000 imaging system and acquired videos were analyzed by DANA Solutions Pulse analysis software (now Curi Bio). Contraction was recorded daily from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction and day 5 to 10 post siRNA treatment. Each siRNA treatment included 6 to 9 wells on two to three independent 96-well plates. Contraction velocity was an average of all wells from the same treatment from the same plate. Averaged numbers of contraction velocity were plotted for each plate from day 3 to day 8 post AAV transduction. Beat period, amplitude, and propagation of electrical signal were detected as extracellular field potential signals from the cardiac monolayers using Axion Biosystems Microelectrode array (MEA) plates\\({}^{\\underline{c}}\\).\n\nCell seeding and maintenance on 12, 24, or 96-well plates followed the manufacturer's recommendation. Data were collected at the time points and analyzed the same way as the contraction velocity.\n\n### Immunofluorescence imaging of iPSC-CMs\n\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before 15 min and permeabilized with PBS + 0.1% Triton-X100 (PBST) at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS three times followed by blocking with PBST + 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells then were incubated with antibodies against PKP2 (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal PAS-53144) at 1:200 dilutions or DSP (Invitrogen, rabbit polyclonal 25318-1-AP; Sigma, mouse monoclonal MAET1492) at 1:100 dilutions or JUP (Sigma, mouse monoclonal P8087) at 1:200 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for overnight. After washing with PBS three times, cells were then incubated with donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, 594 or 647 (Invitrogen) at 1:500 dilutions in PBS + 4% BSA for 2 h. Cells were washed 4 times with DAPI in the final wash, imaged, and acquired on either Leica DMBi inverted microscope with LAXS3.42-Life Science Microscope Software or Molecular Devices ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System with MetaXpress 6 imaging analysis software. Confocal images were acquired from 9 independent cell areas for each well in a format of 96-well plates. Images in different fluorescence channels were merged using ImageJ software.\n\n### Echocardiography\n\nTranstracker echocardiography was performed using high resolution micro-imaging systems (Vevo 3100 Systems. Fujifim VisualSonics) equipped with a 25-55 MHz linear array transducer for mouse heart images acquisition. Briefly, lightly anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice (1-1.5% sublimate and 98.5-99% O\\({}_{2}\\)) were placed in the supine position on a temperature-controlled heating platform to maintain their body temperature at -37\\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. Parastermal long-axis B-mode tracings of right ventricular outflow track (RVOT) were recorded for RV area measurement, parasternal short-axis M-mode tracings of left ventricle (LV) were recorded for left ventricle internal diameter in end diastole (LVIDd) and LV ejection fraction (EF) calculation.\n\n### Electrocardiogram recordings\n\nMice were anesthetized with 1-1.5% isoflurane and 98.5-99% O\\({}_{2}\\) via a nose cone (following induction in a chamber containing isoflurane 4-5% in oxygen). Rectal temperature was monitored continuously and maintained at 37-38 C using a heat pad. Two lead ECG (leads II) were recorded from sterile electrode needles (29-gauge) inserted subcutaneously into the right upper chest with the negative electrode needle and into the left bottom chest with the positive electrode needle. The signal was then acquired and analyzed using a digital acquisition and analysis system (Power Lab; AD Instruments LabChart 7 Pro software version). ECG parameters were quantified after 1-2 min from the stabilized trace. For spontaneous arrhythmias monitoring, mice were monitored for 30 min after anesthesia induction. The arrhythmia severity scoring system is based on these 30-min recordings, please see Supplementary Table 1 for arrhythmia grade chart. This system has limitations, as the short 30-min recording interval and the anesthesia isoflurane can limit the types of arrhythmias observed. All arrhythmias were spontaneously occurring, with no electrical or chemical stimulation used for induction.\n\n### Mouse histology\n\nMice were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine cocktail. First, mice were perfused transcardially with PBS. A scalpel was used to cut hearts into two along the coronal plane and drop-fixed overnight in 10% formalin. Fixed heart tissues were sent to Histowiz (https://home.histowiz.com/routine_histology) for trichrome staining and quantification of fibrosis and immunohistochemical staining of PXR2 and Cxd33 using rabbit anti-PKP2 and rabbit anti-Cx43 (PAS-53144 and 71-0700).\n\n### Cardiac mRNA and protein analysis\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from iPSC-CMs or cardiac RV and LV tissue using the RNeasy Mini or Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, 74106 and 73404), cDNA synthesized (Invitrogen SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for RT) and analyzed by qPCR using Taqman probes to human _PKP2_ or mouse _Pb2_ gene, heart failure genes (_Nppa_, _Nppb_), and fibrosis genes (_Col1a1_, _Col3a1_, _Timp1_). Mouse _Gapid_ served as an internal housekeeping gene control. Absolute transgene mRNA copy number was determined by RT-qPCR using a WPRE-specific RNA standard (Script) across six orders of magnitude. WPRE RNA standard sequence and corresponding primers and probe for RT-qPCR are available in Supplementary Data 1.\n\nCardiac LV lysates in RIPA lysis buffer were analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-PKP2, rabbit anti-DSP, mouse anti-JUP, mouse anti-Cx43, and mouse anti-GAPDH (SC-39371, 25318-1-AP, P8087, 35-5000-3D8A5, and MA5-15738, respectively). DSP protein level in both supernatant and pellet was analyzed to ensure a complete evaluation.\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility\n\nThe numbers of technical and biological replicates and animals for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Normality and Informality tests were performed first to determine whether a dataset is normally distributed. Statistical analyses, ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tukey's post-hoc test), nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's correction, and Student's \\(t\\) test were performed using GraphPadPal Prism 9. Significant differences were defined as \\(p<0.05\\). Error bars in all mouse studies represent SEM (Standard Error of the Mean). Error bars in all cell biology studies represent SD (Standard Deviation). Statistical tests for each individual experiment are provided in the figure legend.\n\nStatistical analyses for RNA sequencing data are detailed below.\n\n### Transcriptional analysis by RNA sequencing\n\nFrom each replicate, 100 ng total RNA was extracted via the polyA-tail-specific protocol according to Illumina Inc. RNA quality control was performed before library preparation using Agilent TapeStation instrument. The RNA libraries were prepared using a Stranded Total RNA Library Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus kit (Illumina), which also removes ribosomal RNA. The libraries were sequenced as \\(2\\times 50\\) base pair paired-end reads using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using V1.5 reagent kit on Si flow cell with an average of 25.66 million reads per each read file (51.32 M reads per sample). After adapter trimming by fastr (version 0.23.3), raw RNA-seq reads from mouse hearts in fastr format were aligned with Salmon (version 1.8.0) to the GENCODE (version M30, July 2022) reference transcript assembly (GRCm39 and Ensembl 107) using best practice parameters to ensure mapping validity and reproducibility (-seqBlas ->eBias ->posBlas ->useVBOtt -rangeFactorizationBins - ->validateMappings ->implicitStBT2). Next, a script using R package _tempor_ was used to generate an expression matrix normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). In this analysis, we only used genes detected in at least 10% of all samples. Protein-coding genes were determined using Ensembl release _mus musculus_ annotations (GRCm39, July 2022) and extracted by _ibromRt_ (version 2.52.0). Mitochondrial genes were also omitted, followed by renormalization to TPM. These gene expression values were then log2-transformed after addition of 1 as pseudo-count. Expression patterns of key genes associated with functions of interest were visualized across treatment groups with boxplots generated using the _ggplot2_ R package. Expression values from both left and right ventricles were included in the boxplots. Relative gene expression levels across groups and two ventricles are also presented in scaled values per gene in the heatmaps. Heatmaps were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_ package.\n\nFor initial assessment and identifying presence of cluster patterns in the transcriptome, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) models were generated in R using the 'promp' function from the _stats_ package. The first two principal components were used to visualize group level differences across samples in a PCA plot generated using _ggplot2_ and _ggfortify_ packages with the 'autopid' function. Differential gene expression analysis was then performed by comparing each two groups of interest using Welch's \\(t\\) test on pseudo-log normalized TPM values. The obtained \\(t\\) statistics values were used to rank-order the genes for the downstream functional analyses. Volcano plots were then generated to visualize the top positive and negative differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the _ggplot2_ R package. The top DEGs are the set of genes with the highest and lowest t-statistics values. To evaluate functional effects, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)\\({}^{\\alpha}\\) on the gene list pre-ranked by t-statistics obtained from differential gene expression analysis, using the _clusterProfiler_ R package. GSEA assesses whether differences in expression of predefined gene sets between two phenotypes are concordant and statistically significant. Gene sets were obtained from positional, curated canonical pathways, transcription factor targets, Gene Ontology, cell type signatures and Hallmark collections in Human MSigDB (v2023.1.Hs)\\({}^{\\alpha+\\alpha}\\). Upon performing GSEA, these gene sets were only considered statistically significant if the false discovery rate (Q value) was less than 0.25 as determined with multiple hypothesis testing correction using the BH-correction method\\({}^{\\beta}\\). The normalized enrichment score, which reflects the degree to which a gene set is overrepresented in the ranked list and normalized for gene set size, was used to select significantly altered gene sets. Trends in normalized enrichment scores for some gene sets of interest were shown in heatmaps, which were generated in R using _ComplexReturnap_.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### AAV:PKP2 corrected disease phenotypes in a human iPSC-CM model\n\nTo model ARVC disease and identify the molecular, structural, and functional signatures that are fundamental to the disease mechanisms, we carried out RNA sequencing analyses of iPSC-CMs after acute silencing of _PKP2_ expression. These studies revealed that the desmosome functions as a signaling hub connecting key structures\\({}^{\\alpha}\\) in cardiomyocytes such that reduction in _PKP2_ expression led to down-regulation of structural and functional gene expression encoding components of desmosomes, sarcomere, intermediate filaments, and ion channels (Fig. 1a). Down-regulation of protein was shown for desmoplkin (DSP), plakoglobin (UDP), myosin-binding protein C3 (MyBPC3), and desmin (DES) (Fig. 1b, the left panel and Supplementary Fig. 1). Trending down-regulation of mRNA was shown for sodium voltage-gated channel a subunit 5 (_SCNSA_) (Fig. 1b, the right panel). PKP2 deficiency resulted in structural disappearance of PKP2 and DSP from the cellular membrane and caused cell disarray of patterned iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1c). In addition, PKP2 deficiency perturbed both contractile (Fig. 1d) and electrophysiological properties of iPSC-CMs (Fig. 1e).\n\nThe 1st generation expression cassette was used for iPSC-CM-based studies and the 2nd generation for in vivo mouse efficacy studies (Fig. 2a). Dose-dependent protein expression was evident in iPSC-CMs driven by a cardiac-specific troponin T promoter (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2). AAV:human PKP2 (AAV:hPKP2), which utilizes an AAV9 variant, CRS9-01, and has a higher transduction efficiency to iPSC-CMs than AAV9\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), restored DSP expression post _PKP2_ silencing when compared to the reduced DSP protein without AAV rescue (Fig. 2c, d). AAV:hPKP2 restored contractility as quantified by contraction velocity when compared to the reduced contraction velocity without AAV rescue (Fig. 2e). Using human iPSC-CMs as a cell model for ARVC, AAV:hPKP2 restored desmosomes and rescued contractility in PKP2-deficient iPSC-CMs, suggesting PKP2 governs intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes.\n\n### Pkp2-cKO ARVC mouse model recapitulated the majority of human ARVC clinical manifestations\n\nWe used a mouse conditional knockout model to assess the feasibility and the efficacy of AAV9-mediated _PKP2_ gene replacement. Consistent with the early observations of this model\\({}^{\\alpha}\\), tamoxifen-induced cardiac deletion of both alleles of _Pkp2_ in adult mice did not show over structural and functional changes at 1 week post induction. Tissue collection at the end of the study and weekly monitoring showed disruption of desmosomes and GJs (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3), high burden of spontaneous premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (Fig. 3b) and occurrences of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) (Supplementary Fig. 4), biventricular dilatation (Fig. 3d), and a sharp decline in cardiac function (Fig. 3c) and survival (Fig. 3e) after 3-4 weeks of induced cardiac knock-out of _Pkp2_. These phenotypes recapitulated human ARVC clinical manifestations. However, unlike in humans, heterozygous disruption of _Pkp2_ in mouse hearts did not result in cardiac phenotypes that closely recapitulated human ARVC symptoms [5, 6]. Thus, homozygous _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse was used as a model of human ARVC.\n\n \n\n**TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment largely attenuated disease development and disease progression to mortality in Pkp2-ekO ARVC mouse.** To determine whether the AAV9 expression cassette (Fig. 2a, the 2nd generation) encoding either the human _PKP2_ or the mouse ortholog could counteract the effects of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion, _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given a single systematic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 (AAV9: human PKP2 at 3E13 vg/kg) or AAV9:mPkp2 (AAV9: mouse Pkp2 at 5E13 vg/kg) 3 weeks prior to tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 4a). A lower dose level of the human ortholog was selected to limit the risk of over-expressing the human protein in this mouse model. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was used as the carrier buffer for TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 to prevent aggregation of capsids. It was administered as the vehicle control to WT and to _Pkp2-ekO_ animals. There were 4 experimental groups: 'WT' and 'ekO' were treated with the vehicle and _Pkp2-ekO_ animals treated with either 'TN-401' or 'AAV9:mPkp2' as shown in Fig. 4.\n\nAt 4 weeks post gene deletion and 7 weeks post AAV treatment, human or mouse PKP2 inhibited the development of frequent PVCs and the occurrence of NSVT as summarized by a ventricular arrhythmia score (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Table 1 used as an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia burden), prevented right ventricular remodeling (Fig. 4c), and prevented decline in left ventricular function (Fig. 4d). Frequent PVCs, RV and LV remodeling, and LV function decline were prominent features of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 4 weeks post gene deletion. TN-401 demonstrated significant efficacy in preventing ARVC development and in extending median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 58 weeks, far beyond the 4.7 weeks observed in the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-ekO_ animals (Fig. 4e). In this same study, we also evaluated efficacy of AAV9:mPkp2 in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice at 3 intervention timepoints and concluded that treatments at 3 weeks before, right after, or 1 week after gene deletion yielded comparable efficacy in EP%, RV remodeling, arrhythmias, and prolonged lifespan of more than 50% of the treated animals by 50 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 5). Overall, these results showed that either the human PKP2 or the ortholog was sufficient to prevent the detrimental cardiac and survival phenotypes of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice when delivered in the AAV9 vector. In addition, we were unable to detect sex difference in either _Pkp2-ekO_ mice or treatment groups (information on sex distribution in each study is detailed in Supplementary Data 1).\n\nTo assess the dose response to TN-401 (Fig. 5) or AAV9:mPkp2 (Supplementary Fig. 6), _Pkp2-ekO_ mice were given single systemic treatments via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, and 1E14 vg/kg one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 5a). All animals were sacrificed at 4 weeks post induction (3 weeks post AAV treatment) for histological and expression analyses. TN-401 treatment of _Pkp2-ekO_ mice showed dose-dependent efficacy in preventing decline of LV ejection fraction, reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight, and a trending reduction in arrhythmias (Fig. 5b). This dose-dependent efficacy was confirmed with larger cohorts of animals in significantly improving LV ejection fraction, reducing RV area and arrhythmia burden, and improving survival (Supplementary Fig. 6).\n\nAt molecular level, left ventricle heart tissue showed dose-dependent protein expression of human PKP2 (Fig. 5c, the top panel; Western blot images in Supplementary Fig. 7) as well as corresponding restoration of DSP and JUP, two additional desmosome proteins that were decreased in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice (Fig. 5c, the bottom two panels). Connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction protein present at intercalated discs, was reduced in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry of heart tissue, and was restored in _Pkp2-ekO_ mice treated with TN-401 (Fig. 5d, the top row). TN-401 treatment also significantly reduced fibrosis development and collagen deposition in both right ventricle and left ventricle (Fig. 5d, the bottom row) and quantification shown in the right graph). In addition, quantitative analyses of molecular signatures supported that TN-401 treatment reduced mRNA expression of heart failure markers (a significant _Npp_ reduction and a trending _Npp_ reduction), fibrosis, and tissue remodeling genes in the right ventricles (only human PKP2 transgene expression was quantified) (Fig. 5e).\n\nOverall, TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 treatment supported a dose-dependent efficacy in improving ARVC phenotypes in _Pkp2-ekO_ mouse model of ARVC. TN-401 or AAV9:mPkp2 in the dose-escalation studies demonstrated efficacy at doses \\(\\geq\\)3E13 vg/kg in preventing adverse right ventricular remodeling, and improving ventricular function, fibrosis, and electrophysiological properties.\n\nThe preventive mode of treatment, dosing before overt structural changes, demonstrated significant benefit of early intervention in largely preventing disease development and extending lifespan. To further examine whether ARVC disease progression could be slowed down or attenuated by restoration of PKP2 expression after overt structural changes, the therapeutic mode of treatment, we dos animals via retro-orbital injection of AAV9:mPkp2 at 1E14 vg/kg at 2.5 weeks after cardiac deletion of _Pkp2_ (Fig. 6a). At 2.5 weeks, overt structural changes were observed that coincided with a rapid development of RV dilation, LVEF decline, and significant ventricular arrhythmias (Fig. 3). Note that the rapid mortality presented by this mouse model (within 3-6 weeks of tamoxifen induction) combined with the relatively slow time course of AAV9 transduction and transgene expression make it challenging to perform the therapeutic mode of treatment. However, at 9 weeks post induction, AAV9:mPkp2 prevented further decline of the left ventricle function when compared to the treated animals at 4 weeks (\\(p=0.9416\\), ns) (Fig. 6c, f), reduced and reversed right ventricle enlargement when compared to the WT level (\\(p=0.6856\\), ns) (Fig. 6d, g). Arrhythmia scores showed a trending, but not statistically significant reduction (Fig. 6e, h). This therapeutic mode of treatment reduced mortality throughout one year follow-up with a median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\)50 weeks (Fig. 6b), which is comparable to the survival benefit observed in the preventive mode of treatment (Supplementary Fig. 6e).\n\n**Restoration of PKP2 expression led to a highly coordinated and durable correction of PKP2-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes.** It was rather surprising to observe that restoration of a single desmosome component, PKP2, led to significant survival benefits, improved cardiac function, reversed adverse RV remodeling, reduced ventricular arrhythmia frequency and severity, and\n\nFig. 1: **siRNA-mediated acute PKP2 silencing impacted both cellular structure and functions of human IPSC-CMs.** **a** Heatmap of RNA sequencing analyses from IPSC-CMs (\\(n=1\\) for negative control, sixNeg, and \\(n=3\\) biological replicates for siRNAs against PKP2, sIFKP2) harvested only day 2, 4,6, and 8, respectively, after siRNA treatment, highlighting effects on genes encoding components of the desmosome, sarcomere, and alcohol channels.**b** PKP2 silencing led to reduction in protein expression of DSP, JUP, DES, and MyBPC3 in response to reduced PKP2 protein (Western blot on the left panel, day 8, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and a trending reduction in SCNS mRNA in response to reduced PKP2 mRNA (RNA sequencing reads from Fig. 1a), ePKP2 silencing resulted in disappearance of PKP2 and DSP protein from the cellular membrane (top two rows, day 10, \\(n=5\\) technical replicates; IXM confocal microscope; 25 \\(\\mu\\)m) and cell disarray in patterned iPSC-CMs (bottom row).\n\nprevented fibrosis. We asked whether \"on-target\" PKP2 effects possibly extend beyond its effects on the desmosome by evaluating PKP2 dose-dependent response, specifically at the transcriptional level. To our knowledge, there has been no reported study that reveals whether (1) PKP2 dynamically coordinates its gene expression with other desmosome members, and (2) to what extent PKP2 quantitively dictates the state of disease progression. To obtain a deeper understanding, two large-scale RNA sequencing analyses were conducted.\n\n_Pkp2-cKO_ mice were given a single systemic dose via retro-orbital injection of TN-401 at 3E13 or 6E13 vg/kg one week before tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion (Fig. 7a) and cardiac function and arrhythmias were evaluated at 4 and 9 weeks post induction. Mice were sacrificed at 9 weeks post induction and heart tissues were collected for RNA sequencing and quantification of PKP2 RNA and protein expression. At a 2-fold expression difference between 3E13 ygkg and 6E13 ygkg doses at 9 weeks (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 8), we did not observe significant dose-dependent difference in key readouts of EF %, LV mass, RV dilatation, and arrhythmia score, although one out of six PKP2 silencing and day 8 of AAV transduction, the left bar graph summarized the percentage of cells without GFP (\\(n=12\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) and with GFP (\\(n=24\\)-\\(36\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates). The right graph showed restored DSP protein expression quantified by total intensity of immunofluorescence signal for Pkp2 silencing in the absence (\\(n=6\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) or the presence (\\(n=12\\)-\\(18\\) technical replicates, \\(n=2\\) biological replicates) of AAV:hPKP2 transgene.

Intriguingly, RNA sequencing analysis at the transcriptional level showed a positive dose correlation to TN-401 among structural genes encoding desmosomes, Cx43, sarcomeres, ion channels and Ca\\({}^{1+}\\) handling proteins (Fig. 7f). When examining expression of heart failure markers and fibrosis genes, we noticed a negative dose correlation to TN-401 (Fig. 7f). Therefore, while key functional readouts of efficacy could not be distinguished between dose levels of 3E13 and 6E13 g/kg, the 2-fold difference in PKP2 transcript levels achieved by these two doses did result in quantitative and dose-dependent changes in transcriptional signatures described above. Based on this observation, we believe that identification of key genes can be informative in associating a transcriptional signature with a particular phase of ARVC disease progression and therefore, may facilitate patient stratification in a more quantitative and precise manner, particularly in early 'concealed' phase when structural changes are not evident.\n\nTranscriptome analyses showed that TN-401 restored expression of structural genes and attenuated expression of genes encoding adverse remodeling factors in a highly coordinated and quantitative fashion. We asked whether such transcriptional response can be sustained to attenuate disease progression and therefore, extend survival over a longer duration.\n\nAs shown earlier in Fig. 6, a single dose of AAV9-mPrkp2 treatment at 1E14 q/kg after overt cardiomyopathy batlied disease progression via reversed adverse right ventricular remodeling, improved LV function, a trending reduction in arrhythmias, and extended median lifespan by \\(\\geq\\) 50 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion. Heart tissues collected at 51 weeks post induction of _Pbz_2 deletion were analyzed by RNA sequencing (Fig. 8a). Compared to intervention before overt structural changes (the preventive mode, animals dosed at 1E13, 3E13 or 1E14 q/kg), AAV9:mPrkp2 intervention after overt structural change (the therapeutic mode, animals dosed at 1E14 q/kg) showed comparable efficacy in extending life span at the same dose, 1E14 q/kg (Fig. 8b). PCA\\({}^{3}\\) showed that transcriptional profiles of AAV9:mPrkp2-treated _Pbz_2-_CRO_ animals were clustered close to WT and distant from vehicle-treated animals, suggesting a normalization of transcriptional landscape close to WT in response to the treatment (Fig. 8c). While the transcriptional profile of low-dose treated animals showed a partial recovery pattern, the transcriptional profiles of the high-dose treated animals effectively overlapped with that of WT samples (Fig. 8c). In addition, when comparing\n\nFig. 4: **An early and single dose of AAV9-PKP2 significantly reduced arrhythmias, improved cardiac function, and prolonged median lifespan to 2 58 weeks post AAV administration.** A study design to evaluate TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 efficacy using _Pbz_2-_CRO_ ARVC mouse model. AAV9 was injected three weeks before gene deletion, TN-401 at 3E13 vector genomes per kilogram bodyweight (yg/kg) and AAV9:mPrkp2 at 5E13 q/kg, Echocardiograph (Echo) and electrocardiogram (EEG) data were collected at week 3 and week 4 post gene deletion. B raw PKC traces showed a significant contrast in spontaneous arrhythmias in _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice in the absence and the presence of TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment. PVCs, premature ventricular contractions, NSVT, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. The right graph summarized arrhythmia scores representing frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias. This arrhythmia score is an overall composite score estimating arrhythmia done (see Supplementary Table 1). Statistical significance in response to TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment was evaluated using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction. c TN-401 or AAV9:mPrkp2 treatment of _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice showed efficacy in reducing RV dilation as estimated by RV area normalized to body weight (mm\\({}^{2}\\)/g) and (**d**) maintaining left ventricular ejection fraction at 4 weeks post gene deletion. Time course of RV dilation was evaluated with ordinary Two-Way ANOVA (Tablev\u2019s post-hoc test), statistical significance shown between the vehicle treated cKO animals and TN-401 treated cKO animals. EPUs was evaluated with ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tablev\u2019s post-hoc test). **Equal**:Meier survival curve showed that TN-401 extended median lifespan of _Pbz_2-_CRO_ mice by \\(\\geq\\)58 weeks post gene deletion. Numbers in paratheses showed dead vs live animals by the time of takedown. Animals treated by AAV9:mPrkp2 (in green line) were taken down early for exploratory studies. Quantified data were presented as mean x.s.m. Sample size \\(n=9\\), 10, 11, 10 for WT, cKO, cKO+TN-401, and cKO+ AAV9:mPrkp2, respectively.\n\n the total number of differentially up- or down-regulated genes relative to the WT animals, the preventive mode and to a lesser degree, the therapeutic mode of intervention showed a significant normalization compared to that between _Pkp2-kCO_ and WT animals (Fig. 8d). When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant negatively enriched gene sets identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)[4] were mitochondrial dysfunction, cardiac muscle contraction, and cardiac muscle conduction. The top significant positively enriched gene sets were predominantly fibrosis related. Both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the\n\nFig. 5: 1 TN-401 **dose-dependently reduced arrhythmias, improved heart structure and cardiac function, restored expression of desmosome proteins and Ctx3 and prevented development of fibrosis in _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse. a Study design to evaluate dose-dependent efficacy of TN-401 using _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse model. Mice were injected with TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, or 1E14 wygfa or one week after tamoxifen induction of cardiac _Pkp2_ gene deletion. At 4 weeks post tamoxifen induction (3 weeks post TN-401 injection), animals were sacrificed for expression and histological evaluation. b TN-401 showed dose-dependent efficacy at 3 weeks in preventing decline of % LV ejection fraction, preventing RV dilation (mm/\\(\\beta\\)), and a trending improvement in arrhythmia scores. Statistical significance of EPPs and RV dilation in response to TN-401 treatment was evaluated with ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test) and arrhythmia scores with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn\u2019s correction. c Semi-quantifative Western had analyses showed restoration of PKP2, JUP, and DSP protein at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA. d Immunohistochemistry for the given motion protein, connexin 43 (Cxt3), in heart tissue sections showed restoration of Cxt3 expression at the total number of differentially up- or down-regulated genes relative to the WT animals, the preventive mode and to a lesser degree, the therapeutic mode of intervention showed a significant normalization compared to that between _Pkp2-kCO_ and WT animals (Fig. 8d). When comparing vehicle-treated _Pkp2-kCO_ animals vs WT, the significant increased discs (DD) at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment (the top panels, 50 \u03bcm). Red arrows indicate DD. Trichrome staining showed a significant reduction of fibrosis, muscle (red) and fibrosis (blue), in heart sections at 3 weeks post AAV treatment (the bottom panels, 2 \u03bcm). Yellow arrows highlight areas with fibrosis in _Pkp2-kCO_ mouse heart. The percentage of collagen-positive tissue was quantified and shown in the right graph. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test), e RT-qPCR analyses of RV tissue at 3 weeks post TN-401 treatment showed expression of _hPKP2_ transgene and suppression of heart failure markers (_Npo1_) (_Npo2_) (_Npp4_ did not show statistical significance) and fibrosis genes (_Collal_, _Colal_, _Timp1_). Graphly used us as internal control. Statistical significance was estimated by ordinary One-Way ANOVA (Tukey\u2019s post-hoc test). Quantified data were presented as mean \\(\\pm\\) s.e. \\(P\\) value: \\(P<0.05\\), \\(\\star p<0.01\\), \\(\\star p<0.001\\), \\(\\star\\star\\star\\)\\(p<0.0001\\). Sample size \\(n=4,4,3,3\\) for WT, kCO, kCO+TN-401 at 1E13, 3E13, 1E14 wyg, respectively. Two animals died between EKG and echocardiogram recordings, and therefore the kCO and kCO+TN-401 at 1E13 wygfa has \\(n=3\\) for echocardiogram parameters.\n\n preventive mode supporting the most complete reversal (Fig. 8e). To our surprise, the long-term survival benefit offered by either mode of intervention was supported by a broad spectrum of sustained correction of gene expression encoding components of the desmosomes, sarcomerey, ion channels and calcium handling systems, along with multiple pathways that regulate metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis as shown (Fig. 8f, g). Once again, both modes of intervention showed significant reversal of these enriched gene sets with the preventive mode effect being most complete (Fig. 8g). Quantitative RT-PCR validated that at the same dose, 1E14 vg/kg, each mode of intervention maintained a similar level of _Pkp2_ transgene expression at 51 weeks, suggesting the mode of intervention does not change the durability of the transgene expression (Fig. 8h). Expression of fibrosis genes (_Timp1_, _Colla1_, and _Col3a1_) were significantly lowered by both modes of treatments at 1E14 yg/kg except for _Col3a1_ in left ventricle in response to the therapeutic mode of treatment. Expression of heart failure genes (_Nppa_ and _Nppb_) showed trending responses to the preventive mode of treatment relative to the untreated cKO animals (Fig. 8h). In agreement with the observation shown by RNA-seq analyses, fibrosis or heart failure genes were reduced to a lesser extent in therapeutic mode than in the preventive mode among age-matched animals (Fig. 8f, g the top panel).\n\nWe concluded that long-term restoration of PKP2 expression by gene replacement approach was correlated with sustained restoration of a broad spectrum of structural genes and pathways, supporting a notion that early intervention is the key to restoring PKP2-associated intrinsic transcriptional networks and their functions and therefore, increasing overall cardiomyocyte fitness to effectively mitigate adverse maladaptive remodeling such as fibrosis as early as possible. These results strongly support that PKP2-associated transcriptional networks can be used to quantitatively evaluate the extent of disease progression and gene therapy efficacy at the molecular level.\n\n### More than 10x an efficacious dose of TN-401 proved to be tolerated in WT CD1 mice.\n\nA six-week pilot tolerability study of TN-401 via intravenous injection at 1E14 or 3E14 yg/kg in WT CD1 mice (Fig. 9a) showed no adverse effects at \\(\\pm\\)10x an efficacious dose on body weight (Fig. 9b), heart weight and ventricular functions (Fig. 9c), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (Fig. 9d), liver weight and enzyme levels (Fig. 9e), and platelet count and hemoglobin levels (Fig. 9f). Histological analyses showed no TN-401-related changes in heart, lung, liver, pancreas, brain, kidneys, and skeletal muscle examined. Pivotal IND enabling toxicology studies conducted by Tenaya Therapeutics demonstrated safety of TN-401 in both mice and non-human primates. Due to the focus of this report, these data are not included, but were contained in the TN-401 IND application, which has received clearance from the FDA.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur preclinical results demonstrated that AAV9-based PKP2 gene replacement approach can offer significant survival benefit in repairing cellular structures of desmosome, GJs, and Ca\\({}^{3+}\\)-handling system, improving cardiac function, reducing PVC frequency and occurrences of NSVT, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling in a cardiac-specific _Pkp2_ knock-out mouse model of ARVC.\n\nAbout 50% of ARVC patients carry a genetic mutation in desmosome genes and approximately 40% of this patient population carries mutations in _PKP2_. The heterogeneity of clinical symptoms of ARVC indicates genetic composition, maladaptive remodeling, environmental factors, lifestyle, and other unknown factors of individuals likely affect disease onset and progression. Although mutations in desmosome genes have been confirmed as an underlying genetic cause of ARVC by large-scale prevalence studies [13, 14, 15, 16, 17], current understanding of the genetic background of this disease is limited and compounded by non-genetic factors and missing molecular links between defective desmosomes and disease development. Using both iPSC-CM and cardiac-specific _Pkp2-cKO_ mouse models of ARVC and AAV9-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression, this study demonstrates that PKP2 is the essential genetic determinant underpinning (1) intrinsic cellular properties of cardiomyocytes; (2) disease onset based on the preventive mode of efficacy studies, which proved AAV9.PKP2 effect to be dose-dependent with significant prevention of multiple disease phenotypes (Figs. 4, 5, 7, and 8); (3) disease progression based on the therapeutic mode of efficacy study, which showed reversal of right ventricle enlargement, halted decline of left ventricle function, a trending reduction in PVC frequency and NSVT occurrence, and most importantly, reduction of mortality (Figs. 6 and 8). As shown in our data, our therapies ameliorated arrhythmia severity by decreasing the PVC burden and the occurrence of NSVT. PVC and NSVT can trigger the differentiating arrhythmias and are associated with increased risk for SCD [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 7 restoration of PKP2 leads to a highly coordinated and durable restoration of structural genes encoding desmosome, sarcomere, and Ca\\({}^{2+}\\)-handling system components, supporting the desmosome as a fundamental molecular regulatory hub in maintaining cellular integrity and function of cardiomyocytes and the heart, overall (Figs. 7 and 8).\n\nThese data further support that an early intervention by gene therapy before overt structural change could project a better prognostic outcome by fixing desmosome-related structural and functional deficits to maintain the overall fitness of cardiomyocytes and to prevent irreversible changes that could compromise the efficacy of gene therapy (Figs. 6 and 8). If overt structural changes have occurred, gene therapy is not expected to be effective, for example, in removing fibrosis or in replenishing more cardiomyocytesytes. These irreversible changes were investigated in our studies as both preventive and therapeutic modes of intervention showed significant reduction of enriched fibrosis gene sets. However, reduction of fibrosis by the therapeutic mode was to a lesser extent with a concomitant trending higher expression of heart failure genes, _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ (Fig. 8f, g the top panel and Fig. 8h). The trending higher expression of _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ in the therapeutic mode of intervention might support observations that the natriuretic peptides encoded by _Nppa_ and _Npbp_ were functionally implicated in cardiac antifibrotic effects [60]. Significantly, both modes of intervention showed comparable survival benefit, dramatically extending lifespan.\n\nTranscriptome analyses of long-term effects of gene replacement in the therapeutic mode did not have a corresponding age-matched control, which would be the vehicle-treated _Pkp2-cKO_ animals that had survived to 51 weeks (Fig. 8). It would be informative to understand the extent of secondary maladaptive remodeling that occurred after overt cardiomyopathy-pathy at the age of 51 weeks as the baseline for our therapeutic mode of intervention. This would allow us to determine whether the secondary maladaptive effects responded to the long-term treatment or to evaluate disease regression with pre-existing overt structural changes.\n\nCardiomyocytes lose due to atrophy or apoptosis puts unique challenges on what might or might not be responsive to therapeutic interventions in adult heart tissue. However, it is intriguing to see proposed reversibility of secondary maladaptive remodeling due to an overall long-term improvement of cardiac performance [61]. The long-term effects by gene replacement targeting cardiomyopathy remain unknown in terms of its potential for disease reversibility. Surprisingly, in our studies, long-term AAV9-PKP2 treatment after overt RV dilatation showed an increased expression of genes underlying sarcomere organization (Fig. 8g, the middle panel with Preventive/WT and Therapeutic/WT). This transcriptional signature could suggest a mechanism of partial regression of adverse structural remodeling due to enhanced sarcomere function in surviving cardiomyocytes. We are currently investigating this possibility.\n\nThere are several limitations inherent to this study. First, the majority of PKP2 mutations in human patients are heterozygous germline mutations. The presentation of disease phenotypes in PKP2-mutated ARVC patients progresses gradually with time as discussed in the introduction. In contrast, our proof-of-concept model is a cardiac-specific conditional knock-out model of _Pkp2_ with severe phenotypes that develop in a short period of time after gene deletion. Therefore, the robust phenotypes presented in this mouse model could possibly have different sensitivities to gene therapy relative to the more slowly developing phenotypes associated with human disease. Since all proof-of concept studies were conducted in mouse models, an important caveat is that the clinical efficacy of TN-401 and other PKP2 gene therapy programs or proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64] (https://rocketpharma.com/aav-presentations-and-posters/; https://www.lexeotax.com/post/lexeo-therapeutics-announces-data-presentations-at-the-26th-american-society-of-gene-cell-therapy-asgct-annual-meeting/) remain to be evaluated in patients with ARVC caused by PKP2 mutations. Second, our study designs and data interpretation were focused on how cardiac function, arrhythmia, and animal survival responded to the gene therapy and on determination of the PKP2 dose-function relationship. We are unable to use this model to evaluate germline impact on organ development and compensatory mechanisms in the presence of PKP2 mutations. Third, although amelioration of arrhythmias in response to the gene therapy was confirmed by EKG and supported by large-scale RNA sequencing analysis on restored gene expression of Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling system, we do not have direct evidence to support a functional restoration of Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling at the cellular level. We are currently investigating Ca\\({}^{+}\\) handling using isolated primary cardiomyocytes from heart tissue in response to the gene therapy.\n\nIn the studies we present, _Pkp2-cKO_ animals treated with the formulation buffer served as the vehicle control to the animals treated with TN-401 or AAV9-mPh2. Although buffer vehicles, empty capsids or AAV expressing GFP served as controls in other gene therapy proof-of-concept studies [61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, \n\n## Conclusions\n\nUsing a cardiac KO mouse model of ARVC, we identified fundamental mechanisms behind disruption of PKP2-associated desmosome function and revealed its broad impact at the transcriptional level on Gjs, sarcomere, ion channels and Ca\\({}^{2+}\\) handling systems, and multiple pathways that critically regulate metabolism, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis. These studies highlight the importance of identifying key transcripts in characterizing ARVC disease state and disease progression in a more quantitative and precise manner. Our efficacy data with PKP2 gene therapy and mechanistic analyses shed more light on understanding ARVC etiology andin practice, may help patients and physicians to make decisions regarding disease management and treatment.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nAll data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this article as Source data.

Deep learning (DL) models use the entire digital signal and could potentially improve predictive power. We aimed to train and validate a 12 lead ECG-based DL algorithm for SCD risk assessment.\n\nMethods Out-of-hospital SCD cases were prospectively ascertained in the Portland, Oregon, metro area. A total of 1,827 pre- cardiac arrest 12 lead ECGs from 1,796 SCD cases were retrospectively collected and analyzed to develop an ECG-based DL model. External validation was performed in 714 ECGs from 714 SCD cases from Ventura County, CA. Two separate control group samples were obtained from 1342 ECGs taken from 1325 individuals of which at least 50% had established coronary artery disease. The DL model was compared with a previously validated conventional 6 variable ECG risk model.\n\nResults The DL model achieves an AUROC of 0.889 (95% Cl 0.861-0.917) for the detection of SCD cases vs. controls in the internal held-out test dataset, and is successfully validated in external SCD cases with an AUROC of 0.820 (0.794-0.847). The DL model performs significantly better than the conventional ECG model that achieves an AUROC of 0.712 (0.668-0.756) in the internal and 0.743 (0.711-0.775) in the external cohort.\n\nConclusions An ECG-based DL model distinguishes SCD cases from controls with improved accuracy and performs better than a conventional ECG risk model. Further detailed investigation is warranted to evaluate how the DL model could contribute to improved SCD risk stratification.\n\nSudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major, global public health problem1. In Europe and the United States, \\(\\sim\\)700,000 individuals will suffer from this mostly lethal condition on a yearly basis2. Given the high mortality rate of SCD, effective primary prevention could make a substantial positive impact but the current approach needs augmentation3. Based on randomized clinical trials, patients identified to be at high risk based on severely reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF \\(\\leq\\) 35%) receive implantable cardi Converter-defibrillators4. However, there is no existing risk stratification methodology for individuals with LVEF \\(>\\) 35% that make up 70% of community SCD5. Moreover, \\(\\sim\\)40-50% of all SCD cases occur in individuals without previously diagnosed cardiac disease, which is a prerequisite for SCD risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: Center for Cardiac Arrest Prevention, Department of Cardiology, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. \\({}^{\\dagger}\\)Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. \\({}^{\\dagger}\\)e-mail: sumeet.chugh@cshs.org\n\nSome novel prediction methodologies that extend beyond the left ventricular ejection fraction have been developed2 but these are still in the research domain. Especially, the standard 12 lead ECG has received a lot of interest in the research field in anticipation of improving long-term SCD risk stratification3. Various ECG abnormalities have been identified to associate with an increased long-term risk of SCD[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 82, 84, 86, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169,previously published a 6 variable ECG electrical risk score that identifies individuals at an increased risk of SCD1. However, conventional ECG-based risk stratification tools are usually limited by low accuracy or practicality, since they include measurements that are not part of a usual ECG interpretation, thus requiring customized measurement or trained medical personnel interpretation.\n\nIn recent years, ECG-based deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed and are being deployed for diagnostic purposes [13]. ECG-based DL models have been successfully trained to detect various cardiac conditions, e.g., LV dysfunction [14], HCM3 or to recognize patients at high risk for atrial fibrillation [14]. As opposed to conventional ECG analysis, DL models do not require manual selecting and extracting of relevant features, which enables them to capture the entire ECG signal and achieve higher prediction accuracy.\n\nIn the current study, we train, test, and validate an ECG-based DL model to identify individuals at high risk of SCD, and compare the predictions with a previously published and validated conventional ECG electrical risk score [10]. The model accurately distinguishes sudden cardiac death cases from controls, performing better than the conventional ECG risk score.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design\n\nWe used two geographically separate community-based, prospective, and ongoing studies of out-of-hospital SCDs in the general population: Oregon SUDS (training, validation, and testing) and Ventura PRESTO (external validation). Given that CAD is the most common underlying substrate for SCD, our control group was designed to represent a control sample with a similar prevalence of previously diagnosed CAD.\n\n### SCD cohorts (Oregon SUDS & Ventura PRESTO)\n\nDetailed methods for Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies have also been published earlier [27, 28, 29]. Both Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies ascertain all out-of-hospital SCDs from the Portland Oregon metro area (population \\(\\sim\\)1 million, Oregon SUDS, since 2002), and Ventura County, California (population \\(\\sim\\)850,000, Ventura PRESTO, since 2015) using an identical approach. Potential SCD cases in the community are identified in collaboration with each region's emergency medical services (EMS) system. Subsequently, established adjudication methods to confirm likely cardiac etiology of SCD were employed by trained physicisearchers; using all available medical record data for each potential SCD case, EMS prehospital care reports, medical examiner's reports, and death certificates from Oregon and California state vital statistics records. SCD was defined as a sudden loss of pulse due to a likely cardiac etiology that occurred with a rapid witnessed collapse, or if unwitnessed, the subject should have been seen alive within 24 h. We included successfully resusculated cases in addition to non-survivors. Cases of likely non-cardiac etiology (e.g., trauma or substance abuse) or chronic minimal illness were excluded.\n\nAll cases with archived resting 12 lead ECGs available for analysis were included (Fig. 1). These ECGs were recorded prior to and unrelated to the SCD event, with a calibration of 10 mm/mV and paper speed of 25 mm/s. ECGs with pac rhythm, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter were excluded a priori to create a DL model that could be applied to ECGs in sinus rhythm. Pre-arrest clinical records and ECGs were available if the patient provided written consent or was deceased, in which case consent was waived by the institutional review boards. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol.\n\n### Control population\n\nWe recruited control subjects from the Portland Oregon metro area to represent individuals at intermediate risk of SCD with a large proportion having CAD. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all control subjects gave informed consent for their data to be used in the study. Control subjects were identified through multiple sources, including patients undergoing angiography, patients having their chest pain assessed by EMS, or patients visiting an outpatient cardiology clinic. We ascertained the control subjects so that the prevalence of CAD and MI was comparable to SCD cases. Control patients had no previous history of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmias. Matching cases and controls for underlying CAD enables the development of a DL model that identifies high-risk patients from a clinically comparable 'intermediate-risk' group. ECGs were obtained and archived in an identical manner to cases.\n\nIn all SCD cases and controls, paper 12 lead ECG recordings were scanned, and digitized using software (ECGScan), which has been demonstrated to provide a robust reconstruction of a digital ECG waveform [3]. Due to the variable length of ECG leads, we restricted the length of each lead in each sample to a 2.5 s strip, which was the minimum length of ECG waveform for each lead. Hence, digital 2.5 s strips of each lead in the 12 lead ECG were used as input for the DL model. ECGScan produces time series ECG signal, and with a sampling rate of 500 Hz, the final shape of each ECG arrays was \\(12\\times 1250\\).\n\n### Deep learning model development and training\n\nTo identify SCD cases using 12 lead ECG waveforms, we developed a convolutional neural network for ECG interpretation (Fig. 2). We trained the model to identify SCD cases with 1,101 prearrest 12 lead ECGs from 1,076 SCD cases from Oregon SUDS and 613 12 lead ECGs from 597 controls. A separate validation cohort of 366 prearrest ECGs and 200 control ECGs was used to determine when to stop model training. The study sample was divided at the patient level so that multiple ECGs from the same patient were included in the same cohort. In the training and validation datasets we used multiple ECGs per patient, but in the internal testing dataset and external validation dataset we used only one ECG per patient (the closest ECG that was unrelated to the SCD event). The mean time from ECG to SCD was \\(2.0\\pm 2.7\\) years in Oregon SUDS and \\(1.6\\pm 2.1\\) years in Ventura PRESTO. We trained the model using the PyTorch DL framework, and the Adam optimizer with default parameters (initial learning rate of 1e-3) with a batch size of 500 and for 55 epochs. Based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the validation dataset, we performed early stopping for training.\n\nThe DL model was designed to interpret 12 lead ECG waveforms starting with atrous convolutions which were followed by multi-channel 1D convolutions. We limited the number of layers to less than 1/10th the size of previously described architectures [13, 14, 15] to minimize model complexity and optimize model runtime. The DL model incorporated convolutional layers after initial atrous layers, with an inverted residual structure. In the DL model, input and output are bottleneck 9 layers with an intermediate expansion layer. To allow information integration across the 12 lead ECGs, the number of input channels increased gradually in each set of expansion layers that were preceded by bottleneck layers. The model was optimized for a lightweight architecture while still maximizing performance [1]. Given that we used ECG waveform instead of images as input data, our deep learning model is a 1D equivalent, and our model is smaller than other ECG models in prior literature with similar performance More details regarding the model architecture can be found in the original papers [23, 24].\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nAll continuous variables are expressed as mean \\(\\pm\\) standard deviation. After model development and training, we performed all statistical analyses on the internal held-out test set and external validation dataset which were never seen during model training. We calculated the model's performance in identifying SCD cases by the AUROC. The model was compared to a previously developed conventional ECG electronic risk score, which evaluates the sum of 6 ECG risk markers: resting heart rate \\(>\\) 75 bpm, LVH, delayed QRS transition, QRS-T angle \\(>\\) 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), prolonged QTc, and prolonged Tpeak-to-Tend interval1. We performed logistic regression models in the internal test dataset and external validation dataset using clinical variables (age, sex, heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure, and cerebrovascular accident) with and without DL-ECG analysis output value (DL-ECG index). We selected the best threshold for the model by maximizing the F1 metric on the validation set and used this threshold to report sensitivity and specificity on the test sets. Similarly, the threshold to report sensitivity and specificity for the conventional ECG electronic risk score and logistic regression models was also selected by maximizing the F1 metric. For each calculation, two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by bootstrapping randomly sampled 50% of the test set for 1,000 iterations. We performed statistical analyses using Python and R.\n\nFootnote 1: https://github.com/google-research/\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nFig. 1: Description of internal and external cohorts.

In comparison to Oregon SUD SCD cases, Ventura PRESTO SCD cases were older (\\(72.3\\pm 14.2\\) years vs. \\(67.5\\pm 14.9\\) years) and more often female (41.3% vs. 35.4%). The prevalence of Hispanic ethnicity (30.7% vs. 2.4%) and Asian race (7.8% vs. 3.3%) was higher in Ventura PRESTO, while the prevalence of White (82.0% vs. 57.6%) and Black race (10.1% vs. 2.1%) was higher in Oregon SUDs. The prevalence of diabetes was 53.2% in Ventura PRESTO and 45.4% in Oregon SUDs. Previously diagnosed heart failure (31.1% vs. 39.8%) and history of myocardial infarction (MI) (27.5% vs. 38.4%) were lower in Ventura PRESTO compared to Oregon SUDs, respectively. The prevalence of COPD was similar (26.6% in Oregon SUDs vs. 22.3% in Ventura PRESTO).\n\nIn comparison to SCD cases, control subjects had a similar prevalence of previously diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD) (51.2%) and MI (30.7%). However, control subjects were slightly younger (\\(65.4\\pm 11.6\\) years) and had a somewhat lower prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes (27.8%), atrial fibrillation (13.4%), heart failure (12.8%), and COPD (9.1%). Demographics and clinical characteristics of SCD cases and control subjects are presented in Table 1.\n\n### DL model performance\n\nIn the internal testing dataset, the DL model achieved an AUROC of 0.889 (95% CI 0.861-0.917) in detecting SCD cases from controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.843 (0.809-0.878) and 0.818 (0.764-0.872), respectively.\n\nIn the external validation dataset, the DL model achieved a comparable AUROC of 0.820 (0.794-0.847) in detecting SCD cases. The sensitivity was 0.763 (0.733-0.796), while the specificity was 0.796 (0.753-0.838). Model performance metrics in internal and external cohorts are presented in Table 2 and AUROC curves in Fig. 3.\n\nWe evaluated the AUCs of models stratified by sex and age. The DL model performed similarly in men and women in the internal cohort (test for difference in AUCs across subgroups, \\(p=0.36\\)), and marginally better in the external cohort among men (AUC = 0.842, 95% CI 0.81-0.874) than among women (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.718-0.831) (\\(p=0.043\\)). No differences were observed in model performance comparing age \\(>\\) 70 years vs. age \\(\\approx\\) 70 years in the internal or external cohorts (\\(p=0.56\\) and \\(p=0.16\\), respectively).\n\n### Conventional ECG electrical risk score performance\n\nWe compared the DL model's performance to a previously developed and validated 6-variable ECG electrical risk score that was independently associated with SCD\\({}^{\\text{th}}\\). In the internal and external datasets, the ECG electrical risk score achieved AUROCs of 0.712 (0.668-0.756) and 0.743 (0.711-0.775) in detecting SCD cases from controls, respectively. The sensitivity was 0.779 (0.721-0.837) in the internal testing dataset and 0.569 (0.515-0.623) in the external validation cohort. The specificity was 0.506 (0.454-0.558) in the internal testing dataset and 0.802 (0.773-0.832) in the external validation cohort (Table 2 and Fig. 3).\n\n### Logistic regression models\n\nTo evaluate the predictive power of DL-ECG index beyond conventional clinical SCD risk factors, we performed logistic regression analyses including clinical variables with and without DL-ECG index in the internal and external datasets. In the internal test dataset, addition of the DL-ECG index into clinical variables improved the discriminative value of SCD from an AUROC of 0.780 (0.741-0.818) to an AUROC of 0.919 (0.895-0.943). Similar results were obtained in the external test set, in which addition of the DL-ECG index into clinical variables improved the discriminative value of SCD from an AUROC of 0.806 (0.778-0.833) to an AUROC of 0.899 (0.878-0.920). Using a cut-point of 0.70 for predicting case status, the net redasfication improvement using the DL model and clinical variables compared to the model with clinical variables in the internal cohort was 28.7% (95% CI 21.0-36.5%) and in the external cohort was 15.3% (95% CI 9.7-20.9%).

The DL model achieved a higher accuracy with an AUROC of 0.889 for internal cohort and 0.820 for external validation, and outperformed the conventional ECG risk score. A slightly lower performance in the external cohort may be related to differences in demographics and clinical profiles, which may affect the accuracy of the model's prediction. However, despite such differences, the overall performance remained good in the external cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ECG-based DL model that has outperformed a conventional ECG risk model in predicting out-of-hospital SCD at the community level.\n\nThere are some unique aspects of study design that made this work feasible. SCD is a dynamic and unexpected event that requires prospective ascertainment1. Since annual incidence is in the range of 50-100/100,000deg, existing cohorts of 5000-10,000 subjects cannot yield sufficient numbers of SCD cases for viable analyses, especially those that employ deep learning models. Furthermore, we were able to include both survivors and non-survivors of SCD in our datasets, which avoids the bias of predicting only non-survivors or survivors. The establishment of the two population cohorts Oregon SUDS1 and Ventura RESTO1 consisting of -1.85 million US residents, provided sufficient numbers for deep learning. Equally important, both studies have been obtaining and archiving digitized 12 lead ECGs performed prior, and unrelated to SCD events. While this is a challenging process for the SCD phenotype, it is a pre-requisite for discovery of prediction models.\n\nFootnote 1: https://github.com/ wearable device technology have enabled recording of the ECG beyond the healthcare environment, during activities of daily living.\n\nAs compared to a previously developed and validated 6 variable conventional ECG risk score, the DL model achieved significantly higher performance in detecting SCD cases, which supports the higher utility of DL-based models. In contrast to conventional risk calculators, DL models do not require manual feature selection and extraction but instead can utilize the entire digital signal to incorporate novel indices of risk. Consequently, ECG DL models are not biased in focusing on pre-specified ECG parameters and thus have the potential to achieve higher throughput and broader scope while preserving accuracy (Fig. 5). Another major advantage of DL techniques in comparison to conventional statistical tools is that they require making fewer assumptions about data structure. Hence, DL models can be more accurate for evaluation of complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. However, DL techniques may also have some disadvantages which need to be considered during development, and also prior to deployment. These include model-specific requirements for inputting data, vulnerability to systemic bias and lack of the ability to explain mechanisms of findings which is still a work in progress.\n\nSCD is a complex trait as well as a multifactorial event, and pathophysiology is based on the interplay between the underlying substrate and a variety of triggers. ECG abnormalities that have been associated with an increased risk of SCD are often surrogates of the underlying cardiac substrate (e.g, LVH, myocardial scarring, repolarization abnormality), and accurate risk stratification requires a combination of several nonspecific ECG abnormalities [11]. Even though ECG may reflect widespread cardiac and noncardiac conditions [12, 13, 14], the logistic regression model showed that DL-ECG index improved the discriminative value of SCD over clinical variables. Similar findings were found in a recent DL-ECG model among heart failure patients [15]. In comparison to conventional dichotomous analytical methods, deep learning-based ECG analysis may provide more precise and comprehensive quantification of ECG abnormalities and deeper phenotyping.\n\nThe vast majority of SCD cases are not identified as high risk prior to their mostly lethal event, which highlights the importance of extending SCD risk assessment beyond left ventricle ejection fraction. While the overall\n\nFig. 4: **Utility of deep learning ECG index beyond clinical risk predictors.** Receiver operating curves for the identification of sudden cardiac death cases in the internal (**a**, \\(n=2792\\)) and external cohort (**b**, \\(n=1043\\)) with logistic regression models.

An effective risk stratification would require both optimal screening population and accurate screening tools, which is likely to consist of a combination of several risk assessment modalities (e.g., ECG, imaging, omics, etc.). ECG abnormalities have already been included in recent SCD risk models[4], and usage of DL based ECG analysis as a pre-screening tool for identification of individuals who could be triaged for more comprehensive risk evaluation could prove effective in selected individuals. Due to the high proportion of CAD and prior MI without a history of ventricular arrhythmias, we think that the control subjects in the present study represent intermediate-risk patients, and given the increased baseline SCD risk, this patient group may represent a reasonable target for screening efforts. However, our study represents the first steps in ECG-DL based SCD risk assessment. As for all DL models that have the potential to be clinically useful, further prospective studies followed by randomized trials are needed to study if DL-based ECG analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive, high throughput, and widely deployable pre-screening tool to augment current SCD risk stratification.\n\nA strength of our study is a large sample of carefully adjudicated out-of-hospital SCD cases with prearrest resting 12 lead ECG. In addition, we were able to create balanced datasets by including clinically comparable control patients. However, some limitations should be considered while interpreting these findings. We matched cases and controls geographically in the training, validation, and internal testing datasets, but we had no geographically matched controls in external validation dataset. However, there was no overlap of control samples between the internal and external validation datasets. The necessity of using a large control group with digitized paper ECGs divided into two was driven by the goal of minimizing the differences in the quality of ECG recordings between cases and controls. The Oregon SUDS study was initiated in 2002 when only paper ECGs were made available, and all case and control ECGs were digitized before providing them to the DL-ECG model. Control ECGs were also obtained randomly from multiple community hospitals and health systems, which further reduces the likelihood of systemic bias in quality of ECG recordings. Since SCD is the first manifestation of heart disease in a substantial subgroup, a prearrest ECG was not available if individuals had not undergone a cardiac evaluation prior to their SCD event, creating potential for selection bias. Although we aimed to match cases and controls based on the underlying CAD status, some differences in other SCD risk factors remained between SCD cases and controls, which may have affected the model performance. However, some of these differences are important contributors to the development of SCD, and the prediction of SCD is based on the identification and combination of risk markers. We used a case-control study design to collect sufficient numbers of carefully adjudicated SCD cases, which does not allow us to reliably estimate the positive predictive value and negative predictive value. We used a relatively short 2.5 s ECG strip, and further studies are probably needed to investigate whether longer ECG strip usage will result in higher prediction accuracies. Our model is only applicable to sinus rhythm ECGs since atrial fibrillation/flutter and pac ECGs were excluded during algorithm development. Lastly, the majority of our study subjects were White, and further studies are needed to study ECG-DL performance in racially/ethnically distinct subgroups. Additionally, future prospective studies are needed to validate model performance in clinically diverse settings.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe trained an ECG-based DL model that achieved high accuracy in distinguishing SCD cases from control patients. The model was successfully validated in a geographically distinct SCD cohort and outperformed a previously validated conventional ECG risk score. These results suggest that DL-based ECG analysis has advantages over conventional ECG based SCD risk assessment and yields better accuracy. Further detailed investigation is warranted to evaluate how the DL model could contribute to improved SCD risk stratification.\n\n## Data availability\n\nAll analytical methods applied for the deep learning algorithm are included in this published article.

Deep learning (DL) models use the entire digital signal and could potentially improve predictive power. We aimed to train and validate a 12 lead ECG-based DL algorithm for SCD risk assessment.\n\n", "Methods": " Out-of-hospital SCD cases were prospectively ascertained in the Portland, Oregon, metro area. A total of 1,827 pre- cardiac arrest 12 lead ECGs from 1,796 SCD cases were retrospectively collected and analyzed to develop an ECG-based DL model. External validation was performed in 714 ECGs from 714 SCD cases from Ventura County, CA. Two separate control group samples were obtained from 1342 ECGs taken from 1325 individuals of which at least 50% had established coronary artery disease. The DL model was compared with a previously validated conventional 6 variable ECG risk model.\n\nResults The DL model achieves an AUROC of 0.889 (95% Cl 0.861-0.917) for the detection of SCD cases vs. controls in the internal held-out test dataset, and is successfully validated in external SCD cases with an AUROC of 0.820 (0.794-0.847). The DL model performs significantly better than the conventional ECG model that achieves an AUROC of 0.712 (0.668-0.756) in the internal and 0.743 (0.711-0.775) in the external cohort.\n\nConclusions An ECG-based DL model distinguishes SCD cases from controls with improved accuracy and performs better than a conventional ECG risk model. Further detailed investigation is warranted to evaluate how the DL model could contribute to improved SCD risk stratification.\n\nSudden cardiac death (SCD) is a major, global public health problem1.

Especially, the standard 12 lead ECG has received a lot of interest in the research field in anticipation of improving long-term SCD risk stratification3. Various ECG abnormalities have been identified to associate with an increased long-term risk of SCD[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 82, 84, 86, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169,previously published a 6 variable ECG electrical risk score that identifies individuals at an increased risk of SCD1. However, conventional ECG-based risk stratification tools are usually limited by low accuracy or practicality, since they include measurements that are not part of a usual ECG interpretation, thus requiring customized measurement or trained medical personnel interpretation.\n\nIn recent years, ECG-based deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed and are being deployed for diagnostic purposes [13]. ECG-based DL models have been successfully trained to detect various cardiac conditions, e.g., LV dysfunction [14], HCM3 or to recognize patients at high risk for atrial fibrillation [14]. As opposed to conventional ECG analysis, DL models do not require manual selecting and extracting of relevant features, which enables them to capture the entire ECG signal and achieve higher prediction accuracy.\n\nIn the current study, we train, test, and validate an ECG-based DL model to identify individuals at high risk of SCD, and compare the predictions with a previously published and validated conventional ECG electrical risk score [10]. The model accurately distinguishes sudden cardiac death cases from controls, performing better than the conventional ECG risk score.\n\n## Methods\n\n### ", "Study design": "\n\nWe used two geographically separate community-based, prospective, and ongoing studies of out-of-hospital SCDs in the general population: Oregon SUDS (training, validation, and testing) and Ventura PRESTO (external validation). Given that CAD is the most common underlying substrate for SCD, our control group was designed to represent a control sample with a similar prevalence of previously diagnosed CAD.\n\n### ", "SCD cohorts (Oregon SUDS & Ventura PRESTO)": "\n\nDetailed methods for Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies have also been published earlier [27, 28, 29]. Both Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies ascertain all out-of-hospital SCDs from the Portland Oregon metro area (population \\(\\sim\\)1 million, Oregon SUDS, since 2002), and Ventura County, California (population \\(\\sim\\)850,000, Ventura PRESTO, since 2015) using an identical approach. Potential SCD cases in the community are identified in collaboration with each region's emergency medical services (EMS) system. Subsequently, established adjudication methods to confirm likely cardiac etiology of SCD were employed by trained physicisearchers; using all available medical record data for each potential SCD case, EMS prehospital care reports, medical examiner's reports, and death certificates from Oregon and California state vital statistics records. SCD was defined as a sudden loss of pulse due to a likely cardiac etiology that occurred with a rapid witnessed collapse, or if unwitnessed, the subject should have been seen alive within 24 h. We included successfully resusculated cases in addition to non-survivors. Cases of likely non-cardiac etiology (e.g., trauma or substance abuse) or chronic minimal illness were excluded.\n\nAll cases with archived resting 12 lead ECGs available for analysis were included (Fig. 1). These ECGs were recorded prior to and unrelated to the SCD event, with a calibration of 10 mm/mV and paper speed of 25 mm/s. ECGs with pac rhythm, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter were excluded a priori to create a DL model that could be applied to ECGs in sinus rhythm. Pre-arrest clinical records and ECGs were available if the patient provided written consent or was deceased, in which case consent was waived by the institutional review boards. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol.\n\n### ", "Control population": "\n\nWe recruited control subjects from the Portland Oregon metro area to represent individuals at intermediate risk of SCD with a large proportion having CAD. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all control subjects gave informed consent for their data to be used in the study. Control subjects were identified through multiple sources, including patients undergoing angiography, patients having their chest pain assessed by EMS, or patients visiting an outpatient cardiology clinic. We ascertained the control subjects so that the prevalence of CAD and MI was comparable to SCD cases. Control patients had no previous history of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmias. Matching cases and controls for underlying CAD enables the development of a DL model that identifies high-risk patients from a clinically comparable 'intermediate-risk' group. ECGs were obtained and archived in an identical manner to cases.\n\nIn all SCD cases and controls, paper 12 lead ECG recordings were scanned, and digitized using software (ECGScan), which has been demonstrated to provide a robust reconstruction of a digital ECG waveform [3]. Due to the variable length of ECG leads, we restricted the length of each lead in each sample to a 2.5 s strip, which was the minimum length of ECG waveform for each lead. Hence, digital 2.5 s strips of each lead in the 12 lead ECG were used as input for the DL model. ECGScan produces time series ECG signal, and with a sampling rate of 500 Hz, the final shape of each ECG arrays was \\(12\\times 1250\\).\n\n### ", "Deep learning model development and training": "\n\nTo identify SCD cases using 12 lead ECG waveforms, we developed a convolutional neural network for ECG interpretation (Fig. 2). We trained the model to identify SCD cases with 1,101 prearrest 12 lead ECGs from 1,076 SCD cases from Oregon SUDS and 613 12 lead ECGs from 597 controls. A separate validation cohort of 366 prearrest ECGs and 200 control ECGs was used to determine when to stop model training. The study sample was divided at the patient level so that multiple ECGs from the same patient were included in the same cohort. In the training and validation datasets we used multiple ECGs per patient, but in the internal testing dataset and external validation dataset we used only one ECG per patient (the closest ECG that was unrelated to the SCD event). The mean time from ECG to SCD was \\(2.0\\pm 2.7\\) years in Oregon SUDS and \\(1.6\\pm 2.1\\) years in Ventura PRESTO. We trained the model using the PyTorch DL framework, and the Adam optimizer with default parameters (initial learning rate of 1e-3) with a batch size of 500 and for 55 epochs. Based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the validation dataset, we performed early stopping for training.\n\nThe DL model was designed to interpret 12 lead ECG waveforms starting with atrous convolutions which were followed by multi-channel 1D convolutions. We limited the number of layers to less than 1/10th the size of previously described architectures [13, 14, 15] to minimize model complexity and optimize model runtime. The DL model incorporated convolutional layers after initial atrous layers, with an inverted residual structure. In the DL model, input and output are bottleneck 9 layers with an intermediate expansion layer. To allow information integration across the 12 lead ECGs, the number of input channels increased gradually in each set of expansion layers that were preceded by bottleneck layers. The model was optimized for a lightweight architecture while still maximizing performance [1]. Given that we used ECG waveform instead of images as input data, our deep learning model is a 1D equivalent, and our model is smaller than other ECG models in prior literature with similar performance More details regarding the model architecture can be found in the original papers [23, 24].\n\n### ", "Statistical analyses": "\n\nAll continuous variables are expressed as mean \\(\\pm\\) standard deviation.

We performed logistic regression models in the internal test dataset and external validation dataset using clinical variables (age, sex, heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure, and cerebrovascular accident) with and without DL-ECG analysis output value (DL-ECG index). We selected the best threshold for the model by maximizing the F1 metric on the validation set and used this threshold to report sensitivity and specificity on the test sets. Similarly, the threshold to report sensitivity and specificity for the conventional ECG electronic risk score and logistic regression models was also selected by maximizing the F1 metric. For each calculation, two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by bootstrapping randomly sampled 50% of the test set for 1,000 iterations.

In Europe and the United States, \\(\\sim\\)700,000 individuals will suffer from this mostly lethal condition on a yearly basis2. Given the high mortality rate of SCD, effective primary prevention could make a substantial positive impact but the current approach needs augmentation3.

Moreover, \\(\\sim\\)40-50% of all SCD cases occur in individuals without previously diagnosed cardiac disease, which is a prerequisite for SCD risk assessment.\n\nFootnote 1: Center for Cardiac Arrest Prevention, Department of Cardiology, Smidt Heart Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. \\({}^{\\dagger}\\)Division of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. \\({}^{\\dagger}\\)e-mail: sumeet.chugh@cshs.org\n\nSome novel prediction methodologies that extend beyond the left ventricular ejection fraction have been developed2 but these are still in the research domain. Especially, the standard 12 lead ECG has received a lot of interest in the research field in anticipation of improving long-term SCD risk stratification3. Various ECG abnormalities have been identified to associate with an increased long-term risk of SCD[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 82, 84, 86, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169,previously published a 6 variable ECG electrical risk score that identifies individuals at an increased risk of SCD1. However, conventional ECG-based risk stratification tools are usually limited by low accuracy or practicality, since they include measurements that are not part of a usual ECG interpretation, thus requiring customized measurement or trained medical personnel interpretation.\n\nIn recent years, ECG-based deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed and are being deployed for diagnostic purposes [13]. ECG-based DL models have been successfully trained to detect various cardiac conditions, e.g., LV dysfunction [14], HCM3 or to recognize patients at high risk for atrial fibrillation [14]. As opposed to conventional ECG analysis, DL models do not require manual selecting and extracting of relevant features, which enables them to capture the entire ECG signal and achieve higher prediction accuracy.\n\nIn the current study, we train, test, and validate an ECG-based DL model to identify individuals at high risk of SCD, and compare the predictions with a previously published and validated conventional ECG electrical risk score [10]. The model accurately distinguishes sudden cardiac death cases from controls, performing better than the conventional ECG risk score.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study design\n\nWe used two geographically separate community-based, prospective, and ongoing studies of out-of-hospital SCDs in the general population: Oregon SUDS (training, validation, and testing) and Ventura PRESTO (external validation). Given that CAD is the most common underlying substrate for SCD, our control group was designed to represent a control sample with a similar prevalence of previously diagnosed CAD.\n\n### SCD cohorts (Oregon SUDS & Ventura PRESTO)\n\nDetailed methods for Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies have also been published earlier [27, 28, 29]. Both Oregon SUDS and Ventura PRESTO studies ascertain all out-of-hospital SCDs from the Portland Oregon metro area (population \\(\\sim\\)1 million, Oregon SUDS, since 2002), and Ventura County, California (population \\(\\sim\\)850,000, Ventura PRESTO, since 2015) using an identical approach. Potential SCD cases in the community are identified in collaboration with each region's emergency medical services (EMS) system. Subsequently, established adjudication methods to confirm likely cardiac etiology of SCD were employed by trained physicisearchers; using all available medical record data for each potential SCD case, EMS prehospital care reports, medical examiner's reports, and death certificates from Oregon and California state vital statistics records. SCD was defined as a sudden loss of pulse due to a likely cardiac etiology that occurred with a rapid witnessed collapse, or if unwitnessed, the subject should have been seen alive within 24 h. We included successfully resusculated cases in addition to non-survivors. Cases of likely non-cardiac etiology (e.g., trauma or substance abuse) or chronic minimal illness were excluded.\n\nAll cases with archived resting 12 lead ECGs available for analysis were included (Fig. 1). These ECGs were recorded prior to and unrelated to the SCD event, with a calibration of 10 mm/mV and paper speed of 25 mm/s. ECGs with pac rhythm, atrial fibrillation, or atrial flutter were excluded a priori to create a DL model that could be applied to ECGs in sinus rhythm. Pre-arrest clinical records and ECGs were available if the patient provided written consent or was deceased, in which case consent was waived by the institutional review boards. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol.\n\n### Control population\n\nWe recruited control subjects from the Portland Oregon metro area to represent individuals at intermediate risk of SCD with a large proportion having CAD. Institutional review boards of Ventura County Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Cedars-Sinai Health System, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all other relevant health systems and participating hospitals approved the study protocol, and all control subjects gave informed consent for their data to be used in the study. Control subjects were identified through multiple sources, including patients undergoing angiography, patients having their chest pain assessed by EMS, or patients visiting an outpatient cardiology clinic. We ascertained the control subjects so that the prevalence of CAD and MI was comparable to SCD cases. Control patients had no previous history of cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmias. Matching cases and controls for underlying CAD enables the development of a DL model that identifies high-risk patients from a clinically comparable 'intermediate-risk' group. ECGs were obtained and archived in an identical manner to cases.\n\nIn all SCD cases and controls, paper 12 lead ECG recordings were scanned, and digitized using software (ECGScan), which has been demonstrated to provide a robust reconstruction of a digital ECG waveform [3]. Due to the variable length of ECG leads, we restricted the length of each lead in each sample to a 2.5 s strip, which was the minimum length of ECG waveform for each lead. Hence, digital 2.5 s strips of each lead in the 12 lead ECG were used as input for the DL model. ECGScan produces time series ECG signal, and with a sampling rate of 500 Hz, the final shape of each ECG arrays was \\(12\\times 1250\\).\n\n### Deep learning model development and training\n\nTo identify SCD cases using 12 lead ECG waveforms, we developed a convolutional neural network for ECG interpretation (Fig. 2). We trained the model to identify SCD cases with 1,101 prearrest 12 lead ECGs from 1,076 SCD cases from Oregon SUDS and 613 12 lead ECGs from 597 controls. A separate validation cohort of 366 prearrest ECGs and 200 control ECGs was used to determine when to stop model training. The study sample was divided at the patient level so that multiple ECGs from the same patient were included in the same cohort. In the training and validation datasets we used multiple ECGs per patient, but in the internal testing dataset and external validation dataset we used only one ECG per patient (the closest ECG that was unrelated to the SCD event). The mean time from ECG to SCD was \\(2.0\\pm 2.7\\) years in Oregon SUDS and \\(1.6\\pm 2.1\\) years in Ventura PRESTO. We trained the model using the PyTorch DL framework, and the Adam optimizer with default parameters (initial learning rate of 1e-3) with a batch size of 500 and for 55 epochs. Based on the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve in the validation dataset, we performed early stopping for training.\n\nThe DL model was designed to interpret 12 lead ECG waveforms starting with atrous convolutions which were followed by multi-channel 1D convolutions. We limited the number of layers to less than 1/10th the size of previously described architectures [13, 14, 15] to minimize model complexity and optimize model runtime. The DL model incorporated convolutional layers after initial atrous layers, with an inverted residual structure. In the DL model, input and output are bottleneck 9 layers with an intermediate expansion layer. To allow information integration across the 12 lead ECGs, the number of input channels increased gradually in each set of expansion layers that were preceded by bottleneck layers. The model was optimized for a lightweight architecture while still maximizing performance [1]. Given that we used ECG waveform instead of images as input data, our deep learning model is a 1D equivalent, and our model is smaller than other ECG models in prior literature with similar performance More details regarding the model architecture can be found in the original papers [23, 24].\n\n### Statistical analyses\n\nAll continuous variables are expressed as mean \\(\\pm\\) standard deviation. After model development and training, we performed all statistical analyses on the internal held-out test set and external validation dataset which were never seen during model training. We calculated the model's performance in identifying SCD cases by the AUROC. The model was compared to a previously developed conventional ECG electronic risk score, which evaluates the sum of 6 ECG risk markers: resting heart rate \\(>\\) 75 bpm, LVH, delayed QRS transition, QRS-T angle \\(>\\) 90\\({}^{\\circ}\\), prolonged QTc, and prolonged Tpeak-to-Tend interval1. We performed logistic regression models in the internal test dataset and external validation dataset using clinical variables (age, sex, heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure, and cerebrovascular accident) with and without DL-ECG analysis output value (DL-ECG index). We selected the best threshold for the model by maximizing the F1 metric on the validation set and used this threshold to report sensitivity and specificity on the test sets. Similarly, the threshold to report sensitivity and specificity for the conventional ECG electronic risk score and logistic regression models was also selected by maximizing the F1 metric. For each calculation, two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by bootstrapping randomly sampled 50% of the test set for 1,000 iterations. We performed statistical analyses using Python and R.\n\nFootnote 1: https://github.com/google-research/\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\nFig. 1: Description of internal and external cohorts.

In comparison to Oregon SUD SCD cases, Ventura PRESTO SCD cases were older (\\(72.3\\pm 14.2\\) years vs. \\(67.5\\pm 14.9\\) years) and more often female (41.3% vs. 35.4%). The prevalence of Hispanic ethnicity (30.7% vs. 2.4%) and Asian race (7.8% vs. 3.3%) was higher in Ventura PRESTO, while the prevalence of White (82.0% vs. 57.6%) and Black race (10.1% vs. 2.1%) was higher in Oregon SUDs. The prevalence of diabetes was 53.2% in Ventura PRESTO and 45.4% in Oregon SUDs. Previously diagnosed heart failure (31.1% vs. 39.8%) and history of myocardial infarction (MI) (27.5% vs. 38.4%) were lower in Ventura PRESTO compared to Oregon SUDs, respectively. The prevalence of COPD was similar (26.6% in Oregon SUDs vs. 22.3% in Ventura PRESTO).\n\nIn comparison to SCD cases, control subjects had a similar prevalence of previously diagnosed coronary artery disease (CAD) (51.2%) and MI (30.7%). However, control subjects were slightly younger (\\(65.4\\pm 11.6\\) years) and had a somewhat lower prevalence of previously diagnosed diabetes (27.8%), atrial fibrillation (13.4%), heart failure (12.8%), and COPD (9.1%). Demographics and clinical characteristics of SCD cases and control subjects are presented in Table 1.\n\n### DL model performance\n\nIn the internal testing dataset, the DL model achieved an AUROC of 0.889 (95% CI 0.861-0.917) in detecting SCD cases from controls. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.843 (0.809-0.878) and 0.818 (0.764-0.872), respectively.\n\nIn the external validation dataset, the DL model achieved a comparable AUROC of 0.820 (0.794-0.847) in detecting SCD cases. The sensitivity was 0.763 (0.733-0.796), while the specificity was 0.796 (0.753-0.838). Model performance metrics in internal and external cohorts are presented in Table 2 and AUROC curves in Fig. 3.\n\nWe evaluated the AUCs of models stratified by sex and age. The DL model performed similarly in men and women in the internal cohort (test for difference in AUCs across subgroups, \\(p=0.36\\)), and marginally better in the external cohort among men (AUC = 0.842, 95% CI 0.81-0.874) than among women (AUC = 0.775, 95% CI 0.718-0.831) (\\(p=0.043\\)). No differences were observed in model performance comparing age \\(>\\) 70 years vs. age \\(\\approx\\) 70 years in the internal or external cohorts (\\(p=0.56\\) and \\(p=0.16\\), respectively).\n\n### Conventional ECG electrical risk score performance\n\nWe compared the DL model's performance to a previously developed and validated 6-variable ECG electrical risk score that was independently associated with SCD\\({}^{\\text{th}}\\). In the internal and external datasets, the ECG electrical risk score achieved AUROCs of 0.712 (0.668-0.756) and 0.743 (0.711-0.775) in detecting SCD cases from controls, respectively. The sensitivity was 0.779 (0.721-0.837) in the internal testing dataset and 0.569 (0.515-0.623) in the external validation cohort. The specificity was 0.506 (0.454-0.558) in the internal testing dataset and 0.802 (0.773-0.832) in the external validation cohort (Table 2 and Fig. 3).\n\n### Logistic regression models\n\nTo evaluate the predictive power of DL-ECG index beyond conventional clinical SCD risk factors, we performed logistic regression analyses including clinical variables with and without DL-ECG index in the internal and external datasets. In the internal test dataset, addition of the DL-ECG index into clinical variables improved the discriminative value of SCD from an AUROC of 0.780 (0.741-0.818) to an AUROC of 0.919 (0.895-0.943). Similar results were obtained in the external test set, in which addition of the DL-ECG index into clinical variables improved the discriminative value of SCD from an AUROC of 0.806 (0.778-0.833) to an AUROC of 0.899 (0.878-0.920). Using a cut-point of 0.70 for predicting case status, the net redasfication improvement using the DL model and clinical variables compared to the model with clinical variables in the internal cohort was 28.7% (95% CI 21.0-36.5%) and in the external cohort was 15.3% (95% CI 9.7-20.9%). Regression model performance metrics in internal and external\n\n\nTable 1: Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects in the internal and external datasetscohorts are presented in Table 3 and AUROC curves in Fig. 4. Examples of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) highlighted ECGs from two SCD cases and two controls from the external cohort are presented in the Supplementary Figure. LIME highlighted a wide range of ECG features including PR interval, QRS complex, and ST- and T-wave changes.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe utilized data from two large geographically distinct community-based out-of-hospital SCD cohorts to train, test, and validate a 12 lead ECG waveform-based DL model, which was compared to a previously validated conventional ECG model. The DL model achieved a higher accuracy with an AUROC of 0.889 for internal cohort and 0.820 for external validation, and outperformed the conventional ECG risk score. A slightly lower performance in the external cohort may be related to differences in demographics and clinical profiles, which may affect the accuracy of the model's prediction. However, despite such differences, the overall performance remained good in the external cohort. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an ECG-based DL model that has outperformed a conventional ECG risk model in predicting out-of-hospital SCD at the community level.\n\nThere are some unique aspects of study design that made this work feasible. SCD is a dynamic and unexpected event that requires prospective ascertainment1. Since annual incidence is in the range of 50-100/100,000deg, existing cohorts of 5000-10,000 subjects cannot yield sufficient numbers of SCD cases for viable analyses, especially those that employ deep learning models. Furthermore, we were able to include both survivors and non-survivors of SCD in our datasets, which avoids the bias of predicting only non-survivors or survivors. The establishment of the two population cohorts Oregon SUDS1 and Ventura RESTO1 consisting of -1.85 million US residents, provided sufficient numbers for deep learning. Equally important, both studies have been obtaining and archiving digitized 12 lead ECGs performed prior, and unrelated to SCD events. While this is a challenging process for the SCD phenotype, it is a pre-requisite for discovery of prediction models.\n\nFootnote 1: https://github.com/ wearable device technology have enabled recording of the ECG beyond the healthcare environment, during activities of daily living.\n\nAs compared to a previously developed and validated 6 variable conventional ECG risk score, the DL model achieved significantly higher performance in detecting SCD cases, which supports the higher utility of DL-based models. In contrast to conventional risk calculators, DL models do not require manual feature selection and extraction but instead can utilize the entire digital signal to incorporate novel indices of risk. Consequently, ECG DL models are not biased in focusing on pre-specified ECG parameters and thus have the potential to achieve higher throughput and broader scope while preserving accuracy (Fig. 5). Another major advantage of DL techniques in comparison to conventional statistical tools is that they require making fewer assumptions about data structure. Hence, DL models can be more accurate for evaluation of complex nonlinear relationships in large datasets. However, DL techniques may also have some disadvantages which need to be considered during development, and also prior to deployment. These include model-specific requirements for inputting data, vulnerability to systemic bias and lack of the ability to explain mechanisms of findings which is still a work in progress.\n\nSCD is a complex trait as well as a multifactorial event, and pathophysiology is based on the interplay between the underlying substrate and a variety of triggers. ECG abnormalities that have been associated with an increased risk of SCD are often surrogates of the underlying cardiac substrate (e.g, LVH, myocardial scarring, repolarization abnormality), and accurate risk stratification requires a combination of several nonspecific ECG abnormalities [11]. Even though ECG may reflect widespread cardiac and noncardiac conditions [12, 13, 14], the logistic regression model showed that DL-ECG index improved the discriminative value of SCD over clinical variables. Similar findings were found in a recent DL-ECG model among heart failure patients [15]. In comparison to conventional dichotomous analytical methods, deep learning-based ECG analysis may provide more precise and comprehensive quantification of ECG abnormalities and deeper phenotyping.\n\nThe vast majority of SCD cases are not identified as high risk prior to their mostly lethal event, which highlights the importance of extending SCD risk assessment beyond left ventricle ejection fraction. While the overall\n\nFig. 4: **Utility of deep learning ECG index beyond clinical risk predictors.** Receiver operating curves for the identification of sudden cardiac death cases in the internal (**a**, \\(n=2792\\)) and external cohort (**b**, \\(n=1043\\)) with logistic regression models. Clinical variables include age, sex, heart failure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, seizure, and cerebrovascular accident.\n\n\nTable 3: Performance of logistic regression models including clinical variables with and without deep learning ECG index in the internal and external datasets incidence of SCD in the community has remained relatively stable, the incidence of SCD in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction has decreased[4], suggesting that the use of LVEF < 35% in risk prediction is progressively less effective. An effective risk stratification would require both optimal screening population and accurate screening tools, which is likely to consist of a combination of several risk assessment modalities (e.g., ECG, imaging, omics, etc.). ECG abnormalities have already been included in recent SCD risk models[4], and usage of DL based ECG analysis as a pre-screening tool for identification of individuals who could be triaged for more comprehensive risk evaluation could prove effective in selected individuals. Due to the high proportion of CAD and prior MI without a history of ventricular arrhythmias, we think that the control subjects in the present study represent intermediate-risk patients, and given the increased baseline SCD risk, this patient group may represent a reasonable target for screening efforts. However, our study represents the first steps in ECG-DL based SCD risk assessment. As for all DL models that have the potential to be clinically useful, further prospective studies followed by randomized trials are needed to study if DL-based ECG analysis has the potential to provide an inexpensive, high throughput, and widely deployable pre-screening tool to augment current SCD risk stratification.\n\nA strength of our study is a large sample of carefully adjudicated out-of-hospital SCD cases with prearrest resting 12 lead ECG. In addition, we were able to create balanced datasets by including clinically comparable control patients. However, some limitations should be considered while interpreting these findings. We matched cases and controls geographically in the training, validation, and internal testing datasets, but we had no geographically matched controls in external validation dataset. However, there was no overlap of control samples between the internal and external validation datasets. The necessity of using a large control group with digitized paper ECGs divided into two was driven by the goal of minimizing the differences in the quality of ECG recordings between cases and controls. The Oregon SUDS study was initiated in 2002 when only paper ECGs were made available, and all case and control ECGs were digitized before providing them to the DL-ECG model. Control ECGs were also obtained randomly from multiple community hospitals and health systems, which further reduces the likelihood of systemic bias in quality of ECG recordings. Since SCD is the first manifestation of heart disease in a substantial subgroup, a prearrest ECG was not available if individuals had not undergone a cardiac evaluation prior to their SCD event, creating potential for selection bias. Although we aimed to match cases and controls based on the underlying CAD status, some differences in other SCD risk factors remained between SCD cases and controls, which may have affected the model performance. However, some of these differences are important contributors to the development of SCD, and the prediction of SCD is based on the identification and combination of risk markers. We used a case-control study design to collect sufficient numbers of carefully adjudicated SCD cases, which does not allow us to reliably estimate the positive predictive value and negative predictive value. We used a relatively short 2.5 s ECG strip, and further studies are probably needed to investigate whether longer ECG strip usage will result in higher prediction accuracies. Our model is only applicable to sinus rhythm ECGs since atrial fibrillation/flutter and pac ECGs were excluded during algorithm development. Lastly, the majority of our study subjects were White, and further studies are needed to study ECG-DL performance in racially/ethnically distinct subgroups. Additionally, future prospective studies are needed to validate model performance in clinically diverse settings.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nWe trained an ECG-based DL model that achieved high accuracy in distinguishing SCD cases from control patients. The model was successfully validated in a geographically distinct SCD cohort and outperformed a previously validated conventional ECG risk score. These results suggest that DL-based ECG analysis has advantages over conventional ECG based SCD risk assessment and yields better accuracy. Further detailed investigation is warranted to evaluate how the DL model could contribute to improved SCD risk stratification.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nAll analytical methods applied for the deep learning algorithm are included in this published article.

In non-EC patients, this therapy leads to marked improvement, including in immune parameters, but unlike ECs, non-EC patients still require ongoing treatment and experience co-morbidities. In-depth, comprehensive immune analyses comparing EC and treated non-EC patients may reveal subtle, consistent differences. This comparison could clarify whether elevated circulating interferon-alpha (iFNa) promotes widespread immune cell alterations and persists post-therapy, furthering understanding of why non-EC patients continue to need treatment.\n\n**Methods** Levels of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) in HIV-infected EC and treated non-EC patients were compared, along with blood immune cell subset distribution and phenotype, and functional capacities in some cases. In addition, we assessed mechanisms potentially associated with IFN\\(\\alpha\\) overload.\n\n**Results** Treatment of non-EC patients results in restoration of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) control, followed by marked improvement in distribution numbers, phenotypic profiles of blood immune cells, and functional capacity. These changes still do not lead to EC status, however, and IFN\\(\\alpha\\) can induce these changes in normal immune cell counterparts in vitro. Hypothesizing that persistent alterations could arise from inalterable effects of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) at infection onset, we verified an IFN\\(\\alpha\\)-related mechanism. The protein induces the HIV coreceptor CCR5, boosting HIV infection and reducing the effects of anti-HIV therapies. EC patients may avoid elevated IFN\\(\\alpha\\) following on infection with a lower inoculum of HIV or because of some unidentified genetic factor.\n\n**Conclusions** Early control of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) is essential for better prognosis of HIV-infected patients.\n\n**Keywords** Energy control of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) is essential for better prognosis of HIV-infected patients.\n\n+\nFootnote \u2020: journal: Article\nhave received anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and a comparison of these results with those of untreated EC patients. If therapy is interrupted in treated non-EC patients, HIV viremia rebounds, demonstrating that anti-HIV therapy is not curative. We show here that therapy removes the bulk of HIV-specific immune cell alterations while controlling IFNa levels, as seen in ECs; however, some residual alterations persist, likely because of IFNa effects before therapy. Furthermore, we identify the cause of the failure in non-ECs of IFNa to contain HIV in the earliest days of infection, which leads to a vicious cycle of IFNa response to increasing HIV titres and ultimately to pathologically high IFNa levels. In turn, non-EC patients sustain early immune cell damage that can persist in part even after therapeutic control of IFNa. Of note, as is usually the case, anti-HIV therapy in these patients was not begun in the earliest days of infection.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Human samples\n\nA total of 73 Healthy donor (HD) samples were obtained through the Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Paris, France). 51 samples were used for serological analysis and 22 for phenotypic analysis. A total of 81 people living with HIV were recruited and subdivided into three groups: EC samples (\\(n=18\\)) were obtained from the Natural Viral Suppressures (i.e., NVS) cohort (Baltimore), untreated non-EC patient (UP) samples (n = 36) were obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Bethesda \\(n=19\\)) and from the Laboratoire de Reference SIDA (Liage \\(n=17\\)), and treated patient (TP) samples (\\(n=27\\)) from NIH (Bethesda \\(n=19\\)) and from Laboratoire de Reference SIDA (Liage \\(n=8\\)). Patient groups did not significantly differ in terms of age, gender, or disease status. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with protocols approved by the regional ethical research boards and the Declaration of Helsinki (H-29331 (USA) and 2020/418 (Belgium)). Clinical data are indicated in Supplementary Table 1a-c.\n\n### Sample processing\n\nPeripheral blood and serum were collected into appropriate tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, St Quentin en Yvelines, France). PBMCs were stored frozen in nitrogen liquid.\n\n### Cell culture\n\nCD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells were isolated from frozen PBMCs. All CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells were positively selected with a CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotore, Bergisch-Glababah, Germany), yielding CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell populations at a purity of 96%-99%. Purified CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells were stimulated as described previously[33] with a \\(\\mu\\)g/mL plate-bound anti-human CD3 (OKT3) monoclonal antibody (mAb; eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and 4 ug/mL soluble anti-human CD28 (CD28.2) mAb (Becton Dickinson) in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukine, Chiron, Amsterdam, 100 U/mL) and recombinant human interferon alpha-2a (Referon-A 0.01-100 ng/mL). After 4 days of culture, membrane CCR5 and CXCR expression was measured by flow cytometry on CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells with an anti-CCR5 mAb (clone REA245 Miltenyi Biotec) and an anti-CXCR4 mAb (clone 12G5, BioLegend).\n\n### Infectious molecular clones\n\nThe infectious molecular clone (IMC) of the CH058 transmitted/founder (T/F) virus (CCR5-tropic) was obtained from the NIH HIV Reagent Program (catalogue number: 11856). The CXCR-tropic T/F virus 40700, which is unable to use CCR5, was identified in an acute CRF01_AE infection. The full-length genome of the 4070 T/F virus was determined using single-genome amplification, as previously described[4]. Detailed information about the 40700 IMC, including the full-length viral sequence, will be described in a separate publication.\n\n### Viral stock preparation and titration\n\nTo generate viral stocks, 6 ug of IMC was transfected into 293 T cells in a T25 flask using the FuGEN6 transfection reagent (Promega). Six hours post transfection, the culture medium containing the plasmids and the transfection reagent was completely replaced with 8 mL of fresh medium. The cells were cultured at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 3 days. Culture supernatants were harvested at 72 hours post transfection, filtered, and stored at \\(-80\\) \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C until use. The infectious titres (TCD50) of the viral stocks were determined on TEM-bl cells.\n\n### Determination of virus growth kinetics in PBMCs\n\nCry cryopreserved PBMCs from one HD were thawed and recovered overnight at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS. The next day, the cells were stimulated with 4 ug/mL plate-bounded anti-CD3 (clone QKT3, eBioscience) and 4 ug/mL soluble anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, eBioscience) in the presence of 100 U/mL IL-2 (Human IL-2 IS, Miltenyi Biotec) in a 96-well U-bottom plate at a density of \\(0.3\\times 10^{6}\\) cells/well. To determine whether upregulation of CCR5 by IFNa could compromise the inhibitory effect of IFNa on HIV-1 replication, cells were pretreated with three different concentrations of IFNa (0.2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL) during the simulation step. Cells stimulated in the absence of IFNa (non-pretreated) were used as a control. Four days after stimulation, cells were washed twice to remove the stimulating antibodies and infected by the CH058 or 40700 T/F virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. At 4 h after infection at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, cells were washed three times with RPMI1640. The infected cells were cultured in a 48-well plate with 500 \\(\\mu\\)L RPMI1640 containing 10% FBS, 100 U/mL IL-2, and a corresponding concentration of IFNa (0.2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, or 5 ng/mL). As a positive control, infected cells (non-pretreated) were cultured in the absence of IFNa to allow determination of the normal replication kinetics of the virus. Culture supernatants were harvested at 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post infection, and virus replication was determined by measuring the p24 concentration in the supernatants.\n\n### Antibody panels, staining, and flow cytometry analysis\n\nImmunophenotypic studies were performed on frozen samples, using flow cytometry panels with up to 23 colours. Approximately \\(1\\times 10^{6}\\) to \\(5\\times 10^{6}\\) frozen PBMCs were used per patient per stain. PBMCs were thawed using RPMI supplemented with 20% FCS per standard protocol. Cells were resuspended at 45 \\(\\mu\\)L FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). To block FC receptor binding, 5 \\(\\mu\\)L of FcB Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi, Paris, France) was added to the cells for 10 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before the staining. Staining was performed in several stages, depending on the number of antibodies. The first mAb cocktail for surface staining, prepared with brilliant vitole, brilliant vitole, and brilliant bath antibodies in Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences, Paris, France), was added to the cells and incubated for 30 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C (see Supplementary Tables 2-4 for antibody panel information). Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before addition of the second mAb cocktail, which contained all other antibodies in FACS buffer for surface staining and viability staining, and incubated for 30 minutes at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. When needed, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eB Bioscience, Paris, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then stained for intracellular targets with the third mAb cocktail in the kit's permeabilization buffer. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and FACS buffer. Before use within this panel, all antibodies were titrated individually to identify the concentration that provided the maximal brightness of the positive cell population and the lowest signal for the negative cell population. Cells were acquired on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer. Data were analysed using flowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). The gating strategy used to identify the immune cell subtypes and their respective subsets is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unsupervised analyses were performed using Cytobank software and R studio software.\n\n### Composite cell phenotypic alteration score\n\nWe generated a cumulative phenotypic score for each T cell subset. The frequencies of the following markers were used to calculate the score: CD25', CD26', HLA-DR', CD38', CTLA-4', CD28', PD1', and CD39'. This score was calculated as the sum of the ratio of marker expression level to the average expression level of the corresponding marker in the HD.\n\n### Cytokine quantification\n\nSerum IFNa and IFNa2 levels were determined using SIMOA cytokine assays (references 100806 and 101419, respectively). Van der Sluis et al. have reported that HIV infection of co-cultures of CD4 + T cells and plasmcytoid dendritic cells ([p]DCs) enhances expression of _IFNa2_ and not _IFNa1_ or _IFNa3_ mRNA, so we focused only on serum IFNa2 levels1.\n\nFootnote 1: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.nih.\n\n \n\n## References\n\n* [1]\n\nFigure 1: **Comparative analysis of major blood immune cell subsets and serum IFN concentrations in UPs, TPs, and HDs.****a** PCA of the data is based on the proportion of different cell subpopulations (CD4\\({}^{+}\\), CD8\\({}^{+}\\), and TCR \\(\\Psi\\)T cells, NKs and DCs) evaluated by flow cytometry, as depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1.

Error bars on graphs represent interquartile ranges.\n\nIFNa-induced CD38 and HLA-DR. In contrast, GrzB, CD26, CD39, inhibitory Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR, and PD1 expression patterns on mature NKs from TPs and HDs are similar (Fig. 3aIV-aVI).\n\nWe next investigated the distribution of CD11c\\({}^{+}\\) myeloid DC (mDC) and CD123\\({}^{+}\\) pDC subsets in the three groups (Fig. 3b). Of note, the pDC frequency is reduced in both patient groups, although more so in UPs, and the mDC proportion also is increased in these groups, although more so in TPs (Fig. 3bII-bIII). The \\(\\forall\\)S T cells, another subset of innate immune response cells, also show functional signalling receptor expression abnormalities (Fig. 3c) with IFNNa-induced HLA-DR, associated in some cases with CD38. These alterations are still significantly more frequent in TPs than in HDs but less than in UPs.\n\nCollectively, these results show that immune cells involved in the innate phase of the immune response still present functional abnormalities in TPs compared with HDs, but at a lower level than in UPs.\n\n### Residual T cell phenotypic profile abnormalities in TPs\n\nTo compare immune T cell profiles among UPs, TPs and HDs, we characterized the T cell subtype frequency and phenotypes, as described in the material and methods and elsewhere[1]. UPs have an abnormal T cell distribution compared with HDs. The frequency of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) in CD3\\({}^{+}\\), CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells (Fig. 4a) is decreased in UPs compared with HDs. This loss of T cells expressing CCR3 also is present in TPs, although to a lesser degree. Compared with HDs, UPs exhibit altered proportions of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminal differentiated EM CD45RA-expressing (TEMRA) cells among the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bI-bII) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bIII-bIV) T cell subsets. TPs will show an abnormal differentiation profile but with normalization of their CM and EM CD8\\({}^{+}\\) frequencies. In addition, UPs compared with HDs exhibit an altered phenotypic profile in T cell subsets (Fig. 4c). This difference can be attributed in part to high IFNa levels[1]. These phenotypic alterations are characterized by an abnormal level of activation/differentiation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, CD25, CD26, CD28) and inhibitory receptors (CD39, PD1, CTLA4) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In general, in contrast to UPs, TPs display immune profiles that are similar to those of HDs. However, some CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell phenotypes in TPs, such as HLA-DR'CM, CD38\\({}^{+}\\)HLA-DR'EM, remain significantly different from those of HDs. After treatment, partial reversion of T cell phenotype anomalies in all CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets is observed, as evaluated using phenotypic alteration scores (see Methods) (Fig. 4cIII-dcfV). Interestingly, in UPs, expression levels of various markers associated with immune dysfunction in the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CM population are directly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 2aIV, 2bIV). This pattern is in keeping with the interpretation that these alterations are induced by a major mediator such as elevated IFNa. No such correlation is found in cells from TPs.\n\nAccording to the phenotypic profile analysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the frequency of Tregs is greater in UPs compared with HDs (Fig. 5aI-all). This increase in Treg frequency, however, is not seen in TPs. In contrast, we found that after treatment, patients still have a high frequency of Tregs lacking CD25 expression[1], with a higher frequency of this CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant in UPs (Fig. 5aIII-5aIV). This altered immune profile of memory Tregs observed in UPs is partially restored in TPs (Fig. 5aV).\n\nCD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets from HIV-infected patients show quantitative and qualitative defects of differentiated CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) and cytotoxic CD8\\({}^{+}\\) suppressive T cells (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supps, KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) in the TEMRA subset (Fig. 5b). In TPs compared with HDs, CTL is increased, with a concomitant reduction in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp (Fig. 5bI and bIII). These populations are similar in UPs and HDs. In addition, compared with HDs, UPs show a higher frequency of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells expressing various markers of activation, differentiation, and exhaustion, whereas TPs display a phenotypic pattern that is somewhat similar to that of HDs (Fig. 5bII, 5bIV).\n\nFurthermore, IFNa-induced CD38 correlates with expression of inhibitory checkpoint proteins (CTLA-4 and PD1) in both CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp in UPs, but not in TPs (_i.e._, after therapy) (Fig. 5bV).\n\nIn summary, the phenotypic anomalies associated with loss of immune cell function of conventional T cells (Tconvs) and Tregs are markedly reduced in TPs compared with UPs, although they show similar features between the two groups, and in large part these are proteins induced by IFNa. The CD8\\({}^{+}\\) functionally linked phenotypic alterations also are of the same nature as those in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells but intensified, and they are markedly reduced after therapy. These immune alterations in both Tconv and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T cells observed before therapy and still present after cART may account for the fragile health suggested by the comorbidities that persist or arise in TPs.\n\n### TPs and ECs share immune profile features\n\nWe next analysed blood immune cell profiles in TPs compared with ECs (Fig. 6). viSNE and PCA analysis indicate that TPs and ECs display similar cell distributions that are distinct from those of UPs and HDs (Fig. 6aI-all). Both TPs and ECs also have normal background levels of serum IFNa. One difference between them is in ySt T cells (Fig. 6aII). There is no difference in the proportion of NK cell subsets between TPs and ECs, but TPs show a decrease in early NK cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6bI). Based on analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in mature NK cells, there is a higher frequency of CD38\\({}^{+}\\) HLA-DR' and PD1\\({}^{+}\\) cells in TPs and ECs than in HDs (Fig. 6bII). Interestingly, TPs and ECs also share a similar percentage of DCs (Fig. 6cI-clI). One difference in the DC compartment is a significant increase in the mDC subset in TPs. Dysregulation of T cell homooeostasis, as observed in untreated HIV -infected patients[3], is maintained in TPs compared with ECs, although to a lesser degree than the previous reported TPs have fewer CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells than HDs (Fig. 6dI). Regarding CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells, TPs and ECs have decreased frequencies of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)T cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6dII). Furthermore, the few T cell phenotypic alterations seen in TPs and ECs are similar (Fig. 6eI, fI and Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, analysis of Treg cells reveals that their frequencies are similar among the three groups (Fig. 6eII). Of note, TPs and ECs show an increase in the CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant compared with HDs (Fig. 6eII). Within CD8\\({}^{+}\\)TEMRA, TPs and ECs show an increase in CTLs (Fig. 6fII) with a concomitant decrease in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells (Fig. 6fIII) compared with HDs. The anomalies observed in TPs and ECs are much less pronounced than in UPs but slightly higher than in HDs (Fig. 6f IV-f V and Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nCollectively, these data show that compared with UPs, TPs and ECs do not express abnormally high levels of serum IFNa, avoiding the pathogenic IFNa effects on immune cells[4]. Particularly notable is the marked improvement in early effective NK cells and the later developing effective antigen-specific HLA-1-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CTL and HLA-E-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells in TPs and ECs. However, these improvements do not completely restore immune status to that of HDs.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdvances in HIV therapy have derived from understanding the molecular events of virus replication and targeting one or more stages with specific\n\nFig. 2: ** Elevated IFNa effect on HIV** **receptor CCR5 expression in human CD4\\({}^{+}\\) **T cells** and **on** **release of circulating HIV** **by** **infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\) **T cells**. **aI CCR5** mRNA expression levels, assessed by RT-qPCR, and (**aII**) CCR5 protein expression level, evaluated by flow cytometry in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells stimulated with different concentrations of TNA(mRNA analysis \\(n=4\\), protein analysis \\(n=7\\), purple) and IFNa2 (mRNA analysis \\(n=5\\), protein analysis \\(n=4\\), orange). **aII** _cXCR4_ mRNA expression levels assessed by RT-qPCR and (**aIV**) CXCR protein expression level evaluated by flow cytometry in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells stimulated with different concentrations of IFNa (mRNA analysis \\(n=4\\), protein analysis \\(n=4\\)).

In addition to developing long-lasting therapies and perhaps targeting the integrated HIV proviral DNA of HIV reservoir cells, alternative approaches are needed. In agreement with the consortium of collaborators working on the ECs (EC consortium) [1], we think a deeper understanding of HIV pathogenesis and how these pathogenic mechanisms do not arise in ECs may be key to advances that could allow for >99% of infected non-EC patients to convert to EC status without treatment and possibly be functionally cured.\n\nAbundant evidence shows that the key events leading to either HIV progression and AIDS or a favourable clinical outcome are predicated on the events of early infection [1]. What that early damage is and its prognostic underpinnings have been unclear. The first signs are the peak HIV viremia and subsequent virus set point. These develop during the initial stage of the immune response, at the time innate immunity kicks in. If not kept under tight control, a high HIV level leaves its mark on future developments. HIV kills infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells, chiefly after antigen activation [8].

It is evident, though, that there is much more to the story, and many reports have shown that despite being uninfected, other immune cells may not function normally. The implication is the existence of some unidentified critical mediator(s) of these effects, acting very early in infection, which excludes candidates involved in specific adaptive immune responses and the inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic stages. Instead, this mediator must be active at the innate stage of the immune response (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nOur results and previous reports lead us to conclude that the main mediator is elevated levels of IFNa[4]. Negative effects associated with IFNa have been described, but usually with the protein as one of several cytokines and acting in a general way to promote inflammation, as occurs in later stages of HIV infection. The details in our reports show that IFNa is more important in an early and specific disease stage. Other contributors to innate immunity are the NK cells. More than 99% of infected persons do not have adequate early control of HIV, so that HIV progression has a tailwind as time passes. As we describe in an accompanying paper [14] and in this report, both NK cells and IFNa show major abnormalities after infection in UPs. NK cells remain unaffected in ECs [4] and are markedly improved in non-EC patients after therapy, as shown here. In these non-ECs, treated patients, NK cells exhibit specific features of normal NK cells, especially in the setting of HLA-B57. Undoubtedly, NK cells are key in the control of HIV in the earliest days after infection. IFNa levels are highly correlated from an early period in UPs, in direct correlation with the HIV titere [25, 26]. In the specific case of HIV, IFNa is not an especially effective antiviral because it concomitantly induces high expression of the HIV co-receptor CCR5, as we show here (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, as we have previously reported, this treatment reduces HIV-inhibitory beta chemokines [26]. In the current work, we demonstrate that in untreated HIV-infected non-EC patients (i.e., UPs), all peripheral blood immune cells at all stages of the immune response show abnormalities in distribution numbers and immune phenotype. Of note, these abnormalities can be induced by elevated IFNa levels, as described in our companion paper and in other specific cases, as we and others have reported [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, cytokines to dangerous inflammation in the later stages of infection with some viruses. Our results here are directed to a newly characterized, early, and continuous solo pathogenic effect of IFNa. These results position increased IFNa as a key direct mediator of HIV pathogenesis, in addition to its known direct HIV effect. The IFNa effect develops along with HIV expansion early after infection and continues through progression to AIDS unless treatment is initiated, except in the case of ECs. As we hypothesize here, this IFNa effect can be avoided in such cases because of low-inculum infection. We emphasize that beyond ART, therapy should include temporarily targeting elevated systemic IFNa as soon as HIV seropositivity is known. This strategy may offer a way to reduce measurable HIV proviral DNA intact sequences down to the EC level [14, 15] while concomitantly providing non-harmful anti-viral IFNa to control other viral infections. Our hope is that this approach will lead to the end of further need for ART, i.e., a functional cure, in keeping with the direction promoted by Walker and colleagues [1].\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data for the main figures in the manuscript can be accessed at figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25125356 [FOOTNOTE:6][EN nonprogressors. _Proc.

In non-EC patients, this therapy leads to marked improvement, including in immune parameters, but unlike ECs, non-EC patients still require ongoing treatment and experience co-morbidities. In-depth, comprehensive immune analyses comparing EC and treated non-EC patients may reveal subtle, consistent differences. This comparison could clarify whether elevated circulating interferon-alpha (iFNa) promotes widespread immune cell alterations and persists post-therapy, furthering understanding of why non-EC patients continue to need treatment.\n\n**", "Methods": "** Levels of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) in HIV-infected EC and treated non-EC patients were compared, along with blood immune cell subset distribution and phenotype, and functional capacities in some cases. In addition, we assessed mechanisms potentially associated with IFN\\(\\alpha\\) overload.\n\n**Results** Treatment of non-EC patients results in restoration of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) control, followed by marked improvement in distribution numbers, phenotypic profiles of blood immune cells, and functional capacity.

If therapy is interrupted in treated non-EC patients, HIV viremia rebounds, demonstrating that anti-HIV therapy is not curative. We show here that therapy removes the bulk of HIV-specific immune cell alterations while controlling IFNa levels, as seen in ECs; however, some residual alterations persist, likely because of IFNa effects before therapy. Furthermore, we identify the cause of the failure in non-ECs of IFNa to contain HIV in the earliest days of infection, which leads to a vicious cycle of IFNa response to increasing HIV titres and ultimately to pathologically high IFNa levels. In turn, non-EC patients sustain early immune cell damage that can persist in part even after therapeutic control of IFNa. Of note, as is usually the case, anti-HIV therapy in these patients was not begun in the earliest days of infection.\n\n## Methods\n\n### ", "Human samples": "\n\nA total of 73 Healthy donor (HD) samples were obtained through the Etablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Paris, France). 51 samples were used for serological analysis and 22 for phenotypic analysis.

In contrast, GrzB, CD26, CD39, inhibitory Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors KIR, and PD1 expression patterns on mature NKs from TPs and HDs are similar (Fig. 3aIV-aVI).\n\nWe next investigated the distribution of CD11c\\({}^{+}\\) myeloid DC (mDC) and CD123\\({}^{+}\\) pDC subsets in the three groups (Fig. 3b). Of note, the pDC frequency is reduced in both patient groups, although more so in UPs, and the mDC proportion also is increased in these groups, although more so in TPs (Fig. 3bII-bIII). The \\(\\forall\\)S T cells, another subset of innate immune response cells, also show functional signalling receptor expression abnormalities (Fig. 3c) with IFNNa-induced HLA-DR, associated in some cases with CD38. These alterations are still significantly more frequent in TPs than in HDs but less than in UPs.\n\nCollectively, these results show that immune cells involved in the innate phase of the immune response still present functional abnormalities in TPs compared with HDs, but at a lower level than in UPs.\n\n### Residual T cell phenotypic profile abnormalities in TPs\n\nTo compare immune T cell profiles among UPs, TPs and HDs, we characterized the T cell subtype frequency and phenotypes, as described in the material and methods and elsewhere[1]. UPs have an abnormal T cell distribution compared with HDs. The frequency of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) in CD3\\({}^{+}\\), CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells (Fig. 4a) is decreased in UPs compared with HDs. This loss of T cells expressing CCR3 also is present in TPs, although to a lesser degree. Compared with HDs, UPs exhibit altered proportions of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminal differentiated EM CD45RA-expressing (TEMRA) cells among the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bI-bII) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bIII-bIV) T cell subsets. TPs will show an abnormal differentiation profile but with normalization of their CM and EM CD8\\({}^{+}\\) frequencies. In addition, UPs compared with HDs exhibit an altered phenotypic profile in T cell subsets (Fig. 4c). This difference can be attributed in part to high IFNa levels[1]. These phenotypic alterations are characterized by an abnormal level of activation/differentiation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, CD25, CD26, CD28) and inhibitory receptors (CD39, PD1, CTLA4) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In general, in contrast to UPs, TPs display immune profiles that are similar to those of HDs. However, some CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell phenotypes in TPs, such as HLA-DR'CM, CD38\\({}^{+}\\)HLA-DR'EM, remain significantly different from those of HDs. After treatment, partial reversion of T cell phenotype anomalies in all CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets is observed, as evaluated using phenotypic alteration scores (see Methods) (Fig. 4cIII-dcfV). Interestingly, in UPs, expression levels of various markers associated with immune dysfunction in the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CM population are directly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 2aIV, 2bIV). This pattern is in keeping with the interpretation that these alterations are induced by a major mediator such as elevated IFNa. No such correlation is found in cells from TPs.\n\nAccording to the phenotypic profile analysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the frequency of Tregs is greater in UPs compared with HDs (Fig. 5aI-all). This increase in Treg frequency, however, is not seen in TPs. In contrast, we found that after treatment, patients still have a high frequency of Tregs lacking CD25 expression[1], with a higher frequency of this CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant in UPs (Fig. 5aIII-5aIV). This altered immune profile of memory Tregs observed in UPs is partially restored in TPs (Fig. 5aV).\n\nCD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets from HIV-infected patients show quantitative and qualitative defects of differentiated CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) and cytotoxic CD8\\({}^{+}\\) suppressive T cells (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supps, KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) in the TEMRA subset (Fig. 5b). In TPs compared with HDs, CTL is increased, with a concomitant reduction in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp (Fig. 5bI and bIII). These populations are similar in UPs and HDs. In addition, compared with HDs, UPs show a higher frequency of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells expressing various markers of activation, differentiation, and exhaustion, whereas TPs display a phenotypic pattern that is somewhat similar to that of HDs (Fig. 5bII, 5bIV).\n\nFurthermore, IFNa-induced CD38 correlates with expression of inhibitory checkpoint proteins (CTLA-4 and PD1) in both CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp in UPs, but not in TPs (_i.e._, after therapy) (Fig. 5bV).\n\nIn summary, the phenotypic anomalies associated with loss of immune cell function of conventional T cells (Tconvs) and Tregs are markedly reduced in TPs compared with UPs, although they show similar features between the two groups, and in large part these are proteins induced by IFNa. The CD8\\({}^{+}\\) functionally linked phenotypic alterations also are of the same nature as those in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells but intensified, and they are markedly reduced after therapy. These immune alterations in both Tconv and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T cells observed before therapy and still present after cART may account for the fragile health suggested by the comorbidities that persist or arise in TPs.\n\n### TPs and ECs share immune profile features\n\nWe next analysed blood immune cell profiles in TPs compared with ECs (Fig. 6). viSNE and PCA analysis indicate that TPs and ECs display similar cell distributions that are distinct from those of UPs and HDs (Fig. 6aI-all). Both TPs and ECs also have normal background levels of serum IFNa. One difference between them is in ySt T cells (Fig. 6aII). There is no difference in the proportion of NK cell subsets between TPs and ECs, but TPs show a decrease in early NK cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6bI). Based on analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in mature NK cells, there is a higher frequency of CD38\\({}^{+}\\) HLA-DR' and PD1\\({}^{+}\\) cells in TPs and ECs than in HDs (Fig. 6bII). Interestingly, TPs and ECs also share a similar percentage of DCs (Fig. 6cI-clI). One difference in the DC compartment is a significant increase in the mDC subset in TPs. Dysregulation of T cell homooeostasis, as observed in untreated HIV -infected patients[3], is maintained in TPs compared with ECs, although to a lesser degree than the previous reported TPs have fewer CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells than HDs (Fig. 6dI). Regarding CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells, TPs and ECs have decreased frequencies of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)T cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6dII). Furthermore, the few T cell phenotypic alterations seen in TPs and ECs are similar (Fig. 6eI, fI and Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, analysis of Treg cells reveals that their frequencies are similar among the three groups (Fig. 6eII). Of note, TPs and ECs show an increase in the CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant compared with HDs (Fig. 6eII). Within CD8\\({}^{+}\\)TEMRA, TPs and ECs show an increase in CTLs (Fig. 6fII) with a concomitant decrease in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells (Fig. 6fIII) compared with HDs. The anomalies observed in TPs and ECs are much less pronounced than in UPs but slightly higher than in HDs (Fig. 6f IV-f V and Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nCollectively, these data show that compared with UPs, TPs and ECs do not express abnormally high levels of serum IFNa, avoiding the pathogenic IFNa effects on immune cells[4]. Particularly notable is the marked improvement in early effective NK cells and the later developing effective antigen-specific HLA-1-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CTL and HLA-E-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells in TPs and ECs. However, these improvements do not completely restore immune status to that of HDs.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAdvances in HIV therapy have derived from understanding the molecular events of virus replication and targeting one or more stages with specific\n\nFig. 2: ** Elevated IFNa effect on HIV** **receptor CCR5 expression in human CD4\\({}^{+}\\) **T cells** and **on** **release of circulating HIV** **by** **infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\) **T cells**. **aI CCR5** mRNA expression levels, assessed by RT-qPCR, and (**aII**) CCR5 protein expression level, evaluated by flow cytometry in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells stimulated with different concentrations of TNA(mRNA analysis \\(n=4\\), protein analysis \\(n=7\\), purple) and IFNa2 (mRNA analysis \\(n=5\\), protein analysis \\(n=4\\), orange). **aII** _cXCR4_ mRNA expression levels assessed by RT-qPCR and (**aIV**) CXCR protein expression level evaluated by flow cytometry in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells stimulated with different concentrations of IFNa (mRNA analysis \\(n=4\\), protein analysis \\(n=4\\)).

Values are medians and \\(p\\) values (\\({}^{*}p<0.05\\), \\({}^{*}p<0.01\\), \\({}^{**}p<0.001\\), drugs. However, therapy is needed throughout life for those who are not ECs. In addition to developing long-lasting therapies and perhaps targeting the integrated HIV proviral DNA of HIV reservoir cells, alternative approaches are needed. In agreement with the consortium of collaborators working on the ECs (EC consortium) [1], we think a deeper understanding of HIV pathogenesis and how these pathogenic mechanisms do not arise in ECs may be key to advances that could allow for >99% of infected non-EC patients to convert to EC status without treatment and possibly be functionally cured.\n\nAbundant evidence shows that the key events leading to either HIV progression and AIDS or a favourable clinical outcome are predicated on the events of early infection [1]. What that early damage is and its prognostic underpinnings have been unclear. The first signs are the peak HIV viremia and subsequent virus set point. These develop during the initial stage of the immune response, at the time innate immunity kicks in. If not kept under tight control, a high HIV level leaves its mark on future developments. HIV kills infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells, chiefly after antigen activation [8]. A small percentage of macrophages also are\n\nFig. 3: **TP distribution analysis of blood innate immune cells.** TPs had a lower percentage and fewer phenotypic alterations compared with UPs. **AI** The SPADE tree shows the distribution of NK cell subsets in HDs (black), UPs (red), and TPs (blue).

It is evident, though, that there is much more to the story, and many reports have shown that despite being uninfected, other immune cells may not function normally. The implication is the existence of some unidentified critical mediator(s) of these effects, acting very early in infection, which excludes candidates involved in specific adaptive immune responses and the inflammatory cytokines associated with chronic stages. Instead, this mediator must be active at the innate stage of the immune response (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nOur results and previous reports lead us to conclude that the main mediator is elevated levels of IFNa[4]. Negative effects associated with IFNa have been described, but usually with the protein as one of several cytokines and acting in a general way to promote inflammation, as occurs in later stages of HIV infection. The details in our reports show that IFNa is more important in an early and specific disease stage. Other contributors to innate immunity are the NK cells. More than 99% of infected persons do not have adequate early control of HIV, so that HIV progression has a tailwind as time passes. As we describe in an accompanying paper [14] and in this report, both NK cells and IFNa show major abnormalities after infection in UPs. NK cells remain unaffected in ECs [4] and are markedly improved in non-EC patients after therapy, as shown here. In these non-ECs, treated patients, NK cells exhibit specific features of normal NK cells, especially in the setting of HLA-B57. Undoubtedly, NK cells are key in the control of HIV in the earliest days after infection. IFNa levels are highly correlated from an early period in UPs, in direct correlation with the HIV titere [25, 26]. In the specific case of HIV, IFNa is not an especially effective antiviral because it concomitantly induces high expression of the HIV co-receptor CCR5, as we show here (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 4). In addition, as we have previously reported, this treatment reduces HIV-inhibitory beta chemokines [26]. In the current work, we demonstrate that in untreated HIV-infected non-EC patients (i.e., UPs), all peripheral blood immune cells at all stages of the immune response show abnormalities in distribution numbers and immune phenotype. Of note, these abnormalities can be induced by elevated IFNa levels, as described in our companion paper and in other specific cases, as we and others have reported [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, cytokines to dangerous inflammation in the later stages of infection with some viruses. Our results here are directed to a newly characterized, early, and continuous solo pathogenic effect of IFNa. These results position increased IFNa as a key direct mediator of HIV pathogenesis, in addition to its known direct HIV effect. The IFNa effect develops along with HIV expansion early after infection and continues through progression to AIDS unless treatment is initiated, except in the case of ECs. As we hypothesize here, this IFNa effect can be avoided in such cases because of low-inculum infection. We emphasize that beyond ART, therapy should include temporarily targeting elevated systemic IFNa as soon as HIV seropositivity is known. This strategy may offer a way to reduce measurable HIV proviral DNA intact sequences down to the EC level [14, 15] while concomitantly providing non-harmful anti-viral IFNa to control other viral infections. Our hope is that this approach will lead to the end of further need for ART, i.e., a functional cure, in keeping with the direction promoted by Walker and colleagues [1].\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data for the main figures in the manuscript can be accessed at figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25125356 [FOOTNOTE:6][EN nonprogressors. _Proc.

UPs have an abnormal T cell distribution compared with HDs. The frequency of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) in CD3\\({}^{+}\\), CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells (Fig. 4a) is decreased in UPs compared with HDs. This loss of T cells expressing CCR3 also is present in TPs, although to a lesser degree. Compared with HDs, UPs exhibit altered proportions of naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and terminal differentiated EM CD45RA-expressing (TEMRA) cells among the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bI-bII) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) (Fig. 4bIII-bIV) T cell subsets. TPs will show an abnormal differentiation profile but with normalization of their CM and EM CD8\\({}^{+}\\) frequencies. In addition, UPs compared with HDs exhibit an altered phenotypic profile in T cell subsets (Fig. 4c). This difference can be attributed in part to high IFNa levels[1]. These phenotypic alterations are characterized by an abnormal level of activation/differentiation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, CD25, CD26, CD28) and inhibitory receptors (CD39, PD1, CTLA4) (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 2). In general, in contrast to UPs, TPs display immune profiles that are similar to those of HDs. However, some CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell phenotypes in TPs, such as HLA-DR'CM, CD38\\({}^{+}\\)HLA-DR'EM, remain significantly different from those of HDs. After treatment, partial reversion of T cell phenotype anomalies in all CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets is observed, as evaluated using phenotypic alteration scores (see Methods) (Fig. 4cIII-dcfV). Interestingly, in UPs, expression levels of various markers associated with immune dysfunction in the CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CM population are directly correlated (Supplementary Fig. 2aIV, 2bIV).

No such correlation is found in cells from TPs.\n\nAccording to the phenotypic profile analysis of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the frequency of Tregs is greater in UPs compared with HDs (Fig. 5aI-all). This increase in Treg frequency, however, is not seen in TPs. In contrast, we found that after treatment, patients still have a high frequency of Tregs lacking CD25 expression[1], with a higher frequency of this CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant in UPs (Fig. 5aIII-5aIV). This altered immune profile of memory Tregs observed in UPs is partially restored in TPs (Fig. 5aV).\n\nCD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell subsets from HIV-infected patients show quantitative and qualitative defects of differentiated CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) and cytotoxic CD8\\({}^{+}\\) suppressive T cells (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supps, KIR\\({}^{+}\\)) in the TEMRA subset (Fig. 5b). In TPs compared with HDs, CTL is increased, with a concomitant reduction in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp (Fig. 5bI and bIII). These populations are similar in UPs and HDs. In addition, compared with HDs, UPs show a higher frequency of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells expressing various markers of activation, differentiation, and exhaustion, whereas TPs display a phenotypic pattern that is somewhat similar to that of HDs (Fig. 5bII, 5bIV).\n\nFurthermore, IFNa-induced CD38 correlates with expression of inhibitory checkpoint proteins (CTLA-4 and PD1) in both CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp in UPs, but not in TPs (_i.e._, after therapy) (Fig. 5bV).\n\nIn summary, the phenotypic anomalies associated with loss of immune cell function of conventional T cells (Tconvs) and Tregs are markedly reduced in TPs compared with UPs, although they show similar features between the two groups, and in large part these are proteins induced by IFNa. The CD8\\({}^{+}\\) functionally linked phenotypic alterations also are of the same nature as those in CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells but intensified, and they are markedly reduced after therapy. These immune alterations in both Tconv and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T cells observed before therapy and still present after cART may account for the fragile health suggested by the comorbidities that persist or arise in TPs.\n\n### ", "TPs and ECs share immune profile features": "\n\nWe next analysed blood immune cell profiles in TPs compared with ECs (Fig. 6). viSNE and PCA analysis indicate that TPs and ECs display similar cell distributions that are distinct from those of UPs and HDs (Fig. 6aI-all). Both TPs and ECs also have normal background levels of serum IFNa. One difference between them is in ySt T cells (Fig. 6aII). There is no difference in the proportion of NK cell subsets between TPs and ECs, but TPs show a decrease in early NK cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6bI). Based on analysis of phenotypic abnormalities in mature NK cells, there is a higher frequency of CD38\\({}^{+}\\) HLA-DR' and PD1\\({}^{+}\\) cells in TPs and ECs than in HDs (Fig. 6bII). Interestingly, TPs and ECs also share a similar percentage of DCs (Fig. 6cI-clI). One difference in the DC compartment is a significant increase in the mDC subset in TPs. Dysregulation of T cell homooeostasis, as observed in untreated HIV -infected patients[3], is maintained in TPs compared with ECs, although to a lesser degree than the previous reported TPs have fewer CCR7\\({}^{+}\\) CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells than HDs (Fig. 6dI). Regarding CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells, TPs and ECs have decreased frequencies of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)T cells compared with HDs (Fig. 6dII). Furthermore, the few T cell phenotypic alterations seen in TPs and ECs are similar (Fig. 6eI, fI and Supplementary Fig. 3). Finally, analysis of Treg cells reveals that their frequencies are similar among the three groups (Fig. 6eII). Of note, TPs and ECs show an increase in the CD25\\({}^{\\text{ns}}\\) Treg variant compared with HDs (Fig. 6eII). Within CD8\\({}^{+}\\)TEMRA, TPs and ECs show an increase in CTLs (Fig. 6fII) with a concomitant decrease in CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells (Fig. 6fIII) compared with HDs. The anomalies observed in TPs and ECs are much less pronounced than in UPs but slightly higher than in HDs (Fig. 6f IV-f V and Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\nCollectively, these data show that compared with UPs, TPs and ECs do not express abnormally high levels of serum IFNa, avoiding the pathogenic IFNa effects on immune cells[4]. Particularly notable is the marked improvement in early effective NK cells and the later developing effective antigen-specific HLA-1-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) CTL and HLA-E-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells in TPs and ECs. However, these improvements do not completely restore immune status to that of HDs.\n\n## ", "Discussion": "", "Data availability": "\n\nSource data for the main figures in the manuscript can be accessed at figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25125356 [FOOTNOTE:6][EN nonprogressors. _Proc.

This article explores the multifaceted causes of school dropout and proposes a holistic approach to prevent it.\n\n**Methods:** This article, structured as a comprehensive review, draws information from existing literature and research studies on school dropout. It synthesizes findings from diverse sources, including academic journals, sociological studies, and educational psychology literature. The information presented here is based on a thorough analysis and synthesis of existing knowledge in school dropouts.\n\n**Results:** School dropout is not solely the student's decision but is often a consequence of prolonged exposure to subtle forms of violence and challenges within the educational environment. It can lead to various adverse outcomes, including deviant behavior and extremism.\n\n**Discussion and Conclusion:** A proactive approach within the school ecosystem is crucial. Combating school dropout effectively involves improving the quality of life in schools, eliminating violence, and providing specialized support through school psychologists and assistants. Additionally, teacher training, emotional support, and bridging connections with parents from challenging backgrounds are essential components of this comprehensive strategy. By addressing these issues, schools can create a nurturing environment that minimizes the toll of violence and retains students, ultimately contributing to a more successful educational system.\n\n**Take-home message**: Addressing school dropout requires a holistic approach centered on prevention. Schools must prioritize students' well-being, combat violence, and employ psychoeducational specialists. Early detection and tailored support can transform the educational experience, fostering student engagement and reducing the cost of violence suffered within schools.\n\n**Key words**: aggressive behaviors; educational violence; pedagogical approach; school assistance; school dropout; student dropouts; violence.\n\n**2020** **Advances in Medicine,**\n\n**Psychology and Public Health**\n\n**MFPH**\n\n**AMPPH**\n\n**AMPPH**\ninitiatives to create a safe and supportive learning environment, thus reducing the prevalence of school dropout and its detrimental consequences.\n\n**METHODs**\n\nThis study adopts a theoretical research approach, primarily relying on a narrative literature review. The research methodology extensively examines existing academic literature, encompassing studies, reports, and scholarly articles on school dropout, violence within educational institutions, and associated factors.\n\nThe review process is systematic, with a focus on identifying and analyzing key themes, patterns, and trends within the literature. Various databases and academic sources are consulted to ensure a comprehensive and up-to-date collection of relevant studies. The inclusion criteria for literature selection encompass studies conducted in diverse settings, with a particular emphasis on those that provide insights into the relationship between violence in schools and the dropout phenomenon.\n\nAnalyzing the selected literature involves synthesizing findings, identifying gaps in knowledge, and drawing connections between various aspects of school violence and its potential impact on students' decisions to drop out. The results of this narrative review will inform the discussion and conclusion sections, shedding light on the significance of addressing violence as a crucial factor in dropout prevention.\n\nOverall, this theoretical study aims to contribute valuable insights and perspectives to the existing body of knowledge, ultimately guiding future research and the development of effective strategies to mitigate school dropout rates.\n\n**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**\n\nThe school dropout issue has garnered significant attention for over a decade, becoming a complex social and political concern. As prematurely leaving school carries profound consequences, it encompasses far-reaching social, economic, and psychological implications. Governments across various nations, including Morocco, have implemented anti-dropout initiatives [1].\n\nHowever, a critical oversight remains regarding risk factors inherent within the school environment, teacher-student dynamics, and immediate surroundings. One notable but often overlooked contributor to school dropout is the presence of mistreatment and bullying within educational institutions [2]. Contrary to the prevailing misconception, dropout cannot be solely attributed to academic failure, learning difficulties, intellectual challenges, or adverse living conditions. This misconception places undue responsibility on the student and their family, framing dropout as a voluntary choice rather than a circumstance they endure [3].\n\nIt is essential to recognize that this perspective predominates in urban areas, diverging from rural regions of the Kingdom. In rural settings, 74% of children are engaged in work, driven by the need to financially support themselves and their families [2]. Economic constraints force these young individuals into early employment, making education a secondary consideration. Additionally, in suburban areas and specific towns in the south, early marriages further compound the challenges faced by the female population, obstructing their educational aspirations [2].\n\nIn alternative scenarios, some students engage in a conscious dropout process motivated by a perceived lack of significance in their education. This phenomenon manifests as academic demobilization, characterized by waning interest in their studies [3]. In such instances, individuals actively discontinue their schooling, prioritizing paid employment over academic pursuits. Their decision is rooted in the belief that the benefits derived from work outweigh the perceived value of continued education [3].\n\nNonetheless, various forms of violence, including bullying, stigmatization, the labeling of students with below-average academic performance, an unsupportive teacher attitude, a sense of impunity regarding disciplinary measures, and instances of victimization, serve as compelling factors propelling students to prematurely exit the educational system [2]. Despite the government's concerted efforts to address the issue, persistently high dropout rates underscore the inadequacy of these interventions [1].\n\nStatistics reveal that the implemented measures predominantly concentrate on post-dropout scenarios, lacking a proactive approach and neglecting efforts to enhance the overall quality of school life. Consequently, the intended objectives have not been fully realized, highlighting the critical need for interventions prioritizing prevention and establishing a positive school environment [1].\n\n_Intervention by specialists: School psychologists and school assistance_\n\nOur proposed hypothesis contends that dropping out of school can be seen as a form of violence and aggression, aligning with the Frustrations-Aggression Theory [1]. According to this hypothesis, students experience this aggression when educational institutions lack or fail to utilize the necessary resources to retain and nurture them (see Figure 1). Essentially, premature departure from the school system is conceptualized as a manifestation of school violence directed against the individual who decides to discontinue their education. In light of these observations, the early detection and intervention in cases of violence or difficulties experienced by students in school, facilitated by psychoeducational specialists and teachers, could significantly enhance the ability to meet students' expectations and prevent school dropout. Proactively identifying issues and targeted support and intervention can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Boredom, behavioral problems, violence, depression, and demotivation serve as indicators of distress within the school environment national statistics underscore the alarming prevalence of school dropout, which poses a substantial threat to the education of young people.\n\nFigure 1: Conceptualization of the school dropout process in Moroccan schools across all levels, particularly in college.\n\nFigure 2 reveals fluctuations in school dropout rates, showing non-linearity over the years. This observation characterizes school dropout as a complex and elusive phenomenon despite the concerted efforts of the Ministry of Education in Morocco. Notably, there was an increase in school dropout during the 2014-2015 school year, followed by a decrease in the subsequent year, with a significant decline between the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.\n\nFigure 2: Dropout rates in Moroccan primary education.\n\n However, a notable surge occurred in the 2018-2019 academic year, followed by a slight decrease in the 2019-2020 academic year. It is evident that the decline witnessed from 2015 to 2018 was substantial.\n\nThe graph depicted in Figure 3 illustrates a significant trend in college dropouts. In the academic year 2014-2015, there were a substantial number of dropouts, totaling 181,609, with 68,586 female students. Subsequently, there was a modest decline in dropout rates from 2015 to 2017. However, beginning in 2017 and extending to 2019, the dropout rates experienced an upward trajectory. Notably, in the academic year 2019-2020, there was a notable surge in dropouts, with 57,573 among female students and a total of 160,837.\n\nThe graph presented in Figure 4 provides insights into dropout rates in secondary education, specifically in qualifying studies. The peak occurred in the 2014-2015 academic year, with 126,288 dropouts, including 58,456 females. Subsequently, there was a decline in these numbers in the 2015-2016 academic year, with 102,664 dropouts in total and 43,976 among female students. In the following year, 2016-2017, the numbers further decreased to 85,608 in total, with 37,412 among girls. However, the phenomenon exhibited non-linear variations, as an increase in dropout numbers was recorded in the 2017-2018 academic year, reaching a total of 93,315 and an increase among female students, totaling 39,420. Conversely, in 2018-2019, there was a shift towards a decline in dropout numbers, resulting in 80,565 total, with 33,725 among girls (Figure 4).\n\nHowever, what remains intriguing is the shift in the figures recorded during the academic year 2019-2020 (see Figure 4). Notably, this period marked the onset of the pandemic, accompanied by adopting a part-time study system involving three days of study per week with reduced hours. The total enrollment for this year stands at 67,134, including 27,271 girls. This data suggests the possibility that the introduction of the three-day study week, as opposed to the conventional six days, may have contributed to meeting the expectations of students, fostering a sense of reduced stress and increased comfort in their academic lives.\n\nFigure 4: Secondary education dropout rates.\n\nFigure 3: College dropout rates.\n\n Nonetheless, dropout rates are most pronounced at the college level, as highlighted by some authors [4]. Early warning signs must be detected to prevent potential student dropouts. These signs often manifest during the college years when students must adapt to a significantly different educational format than that of elementary school. Among these precursors to dropout are sensations of boredom, loss of interest [3], frequent absences, and recurring academic difficulties, which should be identified as soon as they surface.\n\nNevertheless, the phenomenon of dropout varies among students. While not formally leaving school, some experience demobilization due to disengagement from the educational process, classifying them as passive dropouts [5] and gradually moving away from active participation in their education.\n\nThe explanations for the dropout phenomenon reveal that it results from a disconnect and lack of alignment between the student's interactions and relationships within their school and family environments. Often, conflicting values and constraints between these two spheres create turmoil for the student. In this context, dropout becomes a consequence of the socialization difficulties experienced by the student, leading to the deterioration of the link between the young person, the school, and society [6]. In other cases, leaving the school system is the culmination of a gradual loss of interest in education, often compounded by untreated factors related to the student's personality [6,7].\n\nThis dichotomy highlights internal and external risk factors specific to the child and their immediate environment. However, the emphasis should be placed on the student's struggle to adapt independently to two contradictory environments.\n\nThe process of dropping out of school is characterized as a gradual progression [7], drawing attention to the stages that lead to this behavior. Consequently, before the actual act of leaving school occurs, the child may exhibit several discernible symptoms. In classifying dropout typologies, variables related to this behavior manifest at varying intensities from one student to another. These variables encompass antisocial behavior, deviance, and even the emergence of behavioral disorders [3,8], which may escalate to extreme violence, declining academic performance [8], and depression. While commonalities exist among potential dropouts, each case remains unique.\n\nFurthermore, students from modest socioeconomic backgrounds or facing financial hardships [9], marked by precarious living conditions and underachievement in elementary school, are more likely to adopt this behavior. Additionally, students with disabilities [10] can be considered as hidden dropouts. In other instances, characterizing dropouts by psychological traits, including indicators from tests, correlates with the risk of dropping out [11]. These traits encompass aggressive behavior disorders (school violence), delinquency, and depressive states.\n\nRecognition of these factors underscores the credibility of the process-oriented perspective on school dropout. This conceptual framework equips psycho-educators to promptly identify psychological reactions in learners and take timely intervention measures. Importantly, it acknowledges that violence and dropout issues can stem from within the school environment rather than solely originating from external sources such as family or acquaintances. Students exhibiting such behaviors typically share a common thread of experiencing difficulties. In cases where families exert minimal control and display weak cohesion, specialized psychological and educational support becomes crucial, particularly when students may exhibit elevated levels of depression [12].\n\nHowever, even disciplined students with no apparent problems may encounter learning difficulties and fail examinations. Their academic underperformance may not necessarily be attributed to mental retardation or a movement disorder. Consequently, addressing their academic progress would require a pedagogical approach tailored to their pace and cognitive capacities. Failure to implement such measures ad hoc increases the risk of dropouts [3].\n\nTherefore, boredom and a search for meaning within the school environment may persist even among students with commendable academic performance. For these students, the school may appear as an incoherent setting, marked by limited order and organization in the classroom. Notably, despite their academic success, these individuals exhibit an elevated rate of depression [3], underscoring the impact of the school environment on their mental well-being.\n\nThese students also tend to harbor a negative perception of parental and familial emotional support in general [3]. At school, their disappointment arises from the inability to find adequate psychological support, especially from teachers or a multidisciplinary team, to bridge the emotional gap they perceive on both fronts. Conversely, manifestations of violent behavior or aggressiveness [3] can serve as indicators of an impending dropout, with recurrent aggression exhibited at higher intensities than their peers. Educational psychology highlights the connection between violence and school dropout through aggressive behavior disorders, delinquent tendencies, and depressive states [3]. Failure to recognize and address these symptoms within the school environment increases the likelihood of dropout.\n\n_Unpunished school violence and slippage contribute to student dropout_\n\nThe escalation of violence within educational institutions has drawn the attention of both sociologists and educational psychologists, who have identified various forms of violence [13]. At the elementary school level, micro-violence is often witnessed among children, where harm is typically unintentional due to their age. In contrast, middle and high school environments witness more intentional and premeditated forms of violence, encompassing physical, verbal, and psychological aspects. Alarmingly, statistics indicate that approximately one in three children have experienced at least one of these forms and suffered its consequences. In 2017, the Moroccan Ministry of Education initiated collaboration with UNESCO on School Life and Violence, shedding light on the prevalence of physical and verbal violence, with boys being more frequent perpetrators. This trend is particularly pronounced in college-level education, which coincides with the sensitive period of adolescence. The primary causes attributed to school violence are predominantly social and often linked to family issues [14,15].\n\nSanctions for deviant behavior vary depending on each school's regulations and the severity of the transgressions committed. Child aggressors displaying antisocial behavior are typically subjected to temporary exclusion, lasting from a few days to several weeks. However, research on disengaged dropouts [3] has indicated that punitive measures such as suspension, expulsion, and other disciplinary actions are ineffective. In fact, these children often become more prone to violence and repeat their offenses. This approach to discipline not only exacerbates educational backwardness but also contributes to demotivation.\n\nMoreover, these young individuals persist in their behaviors while enduring stigmatization, feeling a deep sense of shame that prevents them from confronting the often-contemptuous gaze of their peers. The prevailing punitive model [3] perpetuates this cycle of judgment and shame, raising a critical question: could this punitive approach alone be a significant factor in the decision to drop out of school?\n\nIn many instances, students are left to face school violence, whether psychological, physical, or verbal, on their own. Repeated attacks on students, coupled with their eventual resignation, contribute to an ongoing cycle of harassment. The entire class may align against the targeted student, creating an environment where the school atmosphere deteriorates, and the victim endures daily harassment, cyberbullying, and even sexual harassment [16].\n\nTo illustrate one of many scenarios within the school context, classmates may subject a student to relentless harassment. Additionally, violence endured by students may not always be reported to the administration by adults, resulting in no disciplinary actions taken against the perpetrators of mistreatment.\n\nBeyond the school premises, students may become subjects of mockery and face the risk of collective aggression by their peers. Physical assaults may occur in various locations, including locker rooms, hallways, yards, transportation, or even in the school cafeteria. The student may endure pushing, beating, and mistreatment from others.\n\nHarassers, recognizing the harm inflicted on their victims, often employ covert tactics to avoid the vigilance of adults. Therefore, it becomes imperative for schools to have an anti-bullying policy [17] in place, coupled with the quality of the policy's content [18], to effectively prevent victimization.\n\nIn most cases, victims of harassment choose to endure their suffering in silence rather than reporting it to their parents. They fear parental rejection, damage to their pride, and a potential blow to their self-esteem. However, clinical signs [17,19], such as sleep difficulties, bedwetting, headaches, stomachaches, neck or back pain, can alert parents or loved ones to potential harassment. In addition to physical signs like strangulation, bloodshot eyes, and bruises, children may display other indicators both at school and at home. At school, their academic performance may significantly decline. The child may cease to complete homework, arrive without necessary materials, and pretend to have forgotten them when, in reality, they are unusable due to aggression. These conditions greatly affect concentration levels, leading to a considerable drop in performance. Anxiety and psychosomatic problems [17] may poison the student's memory as they anticipate further bullying.\n\nAt home, the child may exhibit irritability and an excessive fixation on video games or their phone. Other anxiety-related somatic symptoms, such as sleep or eating disorders, episodes of crying, and depressive tendencies [20], may emerge in children. These signs should be regarded as warning signals. Consequently, many children attempt to escape these difficulties by avoiding the situation, resulting in accumulative delays and absences.\n\nIn the short term, the consequences of this violence can hinder a student's intellectual development and academic success. Over time, this discomfort can lead many children to drop out. In the long term, depressive tendencies [20] may manifest in some, along with an inability to engage socially and even suicidal tendencies [19,21]. When a child is placed in an institution that recognizes their symptoms and facilitates genuine communication and support between the teacher [16] and the psycho-pedagogical team, they can be salvaged.\n\n_A stigmatizing school environment and stereotypes surrounding school failure can constitue significant forms of violence against students_\n\nThe deterioration of academic performance is frequently cited as a common characteristic of dropouts and one of the most potent predictors, mainly when it occurs early [3,11,22,23]. Students facing academic challenges often find themselves condemned both at school and at home, with little effort made to understand the underlying causes of their academic struggles.\n\nChildren with lower academic achievement can experience stigmatization [17], labeling, and relegation to the bottom ranks within the school setting. This often occurs when teachers prioritize their attention toward studious and disciplined students, who frequently occupy the front rows of the classroom.\n\n At home, students at risk of dropping out often encounter judgment from parents and relatives who equate school failure with failure in life. For parents, their child's academic struggles can challenge their perception of being good parents, leading to heightened anxiety and exaggerated reactions. Instead of engaging constructively with the school and relevant stakeholders or providing encouragement, some parents exacerbate the situation by perpetuating conflicts and continually demeaning and blaming their children.\n\nThe combined impact of parental and school-related abuse can ultimately disorient the child. Consequently, for a young person who perceives themselves as socially insignificant or useless, dropping out may be seen as an act of rebellion or a quest for meaning and identity elsewhere, potentially leading to delinquency [3] and extremism. Psychologically, the uncertainty about the dropout's future can manifest as emotional distress, which some may attempt to cope with through avoidance or substance abuse [3] like drugs or alcohol.\n\nA disruption in education or a lack of academic achievement can severely jeopardize a young person's prospects for professional integration, social status, identity, and future autonomy. As a result, dropouts face heightened challenges in striving for professional stability. Without strong qualifications or diplomas, they often find themselves in precarious employment situations, uncertain about their future. In Morocco, this contributes to the prolonged dependence of youth on their family structures, with a substantial 82% of young individuals still residing with at least one parent, even into adulthood.\n\nIn some cases, the label of \"dropout\" not only identifies the student as someone who left school prematurely but also as a problematic individual. This social representation, or stereotype, vividly illustrates the damaging impact of stigma within schools. Conversely, students perceived as problematic may receive social labels that push them towards a deviant path. Similarly, categorizing students based on cognitive performance becomes a significant risk factor for school dropout.\n\nFrequently, students are classified as either academically strong or weak. These labels can persist, with children internalizing and identifying with the given label within the school environment. The degree of acceptance of these labels often depends on their frequency and the source's authority. Unintentionally, teachers may contribute to reinforcing these distinctions by consistently selecting only high-achieving students for various activities. Consequently, the public nature of labeling perpetuates its institutionalization, further increasing the dropout risk. Raising awareness among teachers about the necessity to avoid labeling, especially through training [20], is crucial.\n\nFor some girls, early pregnancies often result in dropping out [6, 24]. This is why the government has implemented policies to facilitate their return to education and training. In Morocco, concrete and immediate emergency plans were initiated by the government in May 2018 to address the issue of school dropouts.\n\nRegarding safety, the social consequences of dropping out can be substantial. On one hand, idleness resulting from leaving school may contribute to increased social violence and risky behavior. On the other hand, out-of-school students are twice as likely to face unemployment, engage in delinquent activities such as theft, resort to a life of crime, and use drugs [9]. In certain cases, dropping out is linked to an elevated risk of suicide [19, 21], while in other instances, these young individuals may become victims of acts of extremism and radicalization [7].\n\n_The \"Pygmalion Effect\": Impact of teacher expectations on student progress_\n\nAs elucidated by numerous authors [25], the Pygmalion effect elucidates the interplay between a teacher's expectations and students' academic performance. When a teacher maintains a positive outlook, particularly a positive a priori, students tend to be more motivated and achieve better results. Conversely, if a teacher holds negative preconceptions about a student or their class, it can harm academic performance, potentially decreasing their achievements. Often, this influence may go unnoticed by the teacher, making it imperative to be particularly attuned to the teacher's perception and its impact on a child's behavior within the educational realm.\n\nNeuroscience advances support lifelong learning [26], contingent on the learner's self-confidence, self-esteem, and motivation. The human brain exhibits plasticity, continuing to develop throughout one's life for learning [26]. It suggests that students inherently possess the potential for high academic performance, provided their environment, school, and education foster their development and enhance their latent capabilities.\n\nIn this context, examining factors contributing to disparities in social achievements and educational outcomes, particularly among children, has been a topic of interest in social psychology. Debates have revolved around the relative impact of heredity versus environment as determining factors for success. Studies have shown that the environment is crucial to real-world success [27]. Specifically, a child raised in a nurturing environment with balanced parental and familial support is more likely to succeed than a child whose parents have relinquished their involvement, especially when the school does not sufficiently assume the role of education and guidance. Similarly, exposing children to diverse leisure activities and fostering open, attentive communication can contribute to their success. Paradoxically, an educational deficit can hinder a child's development and cognitive abilities, even if they are intellectually gifted.\n\nTeachers may ponder several questions: Beyond academic education, does the student experience a quality of life and opportunities for personal growth and educational enrichment through sports and other activities? _Dropout as an aggressive behavior stemming from student frustration_\n\nIn summary, considering the elements discussed above, it is important to confirm the hypothesis that a young dropout is not solely responsible for their decision to leave school. Various factors, including subtle forms of violence such as harassment, criticism, and stigmatization related to educational difficulties, may gradually contribute to their choice to drop out. The act of dropping out can be seen as a manifestation of aggressive behavior, a consequence of the accumulated frustrations (Frustrations-Aggression Theory [1]) experienced by the student throughout their educational journey.\n\nNumerous studies underscore a significant correlation between school dropout and experiences of violence [10, 17]. This underscores a gap in the prevailing perception of the phenomenon, as some attribute the issue more to the student and their family.\n\nThe experience of dropping out may vary among students, with some being compelled by external factors while others actively and voluntarily choose to discontinue their education. For some, leaving school early is perceived as a rational decision, considering the cost-risk-benefit dynamics, especially when they do not find meaning in their academic pursuits.\n\nHowever, regardless of the origins and sources of this phenomenon, it unfolds within the educational framework. Therefore, engaging students exhibiting risky behaviors or underlying, and apparent difficulties is crucial. On the other hand, a preventative and intervention system addressing violence and school dropout in Morocco can be implemented proactively before the actual act of dropping out occurs.\n\n_Implementing a comprehensive anti-dropout prevention strategy: Ecosystem-level school transformation_\n\nTo address the pressing issue of school dropout, schools must regain their central role in education and student development. State-of-the-art teacher training and cultivating a caring attitude [28] toward students is paramount. These efforts are essential to rectify educational deficiencies through early detection and tailored guidance for each student.\n\nPrevention strategies should encompass the involvement of the psychoeducational team and parents. Research on dropout rates [6] has confirmed that peer mentoring is one of the most cost-effective tools for dropout prevention. Additionally, implementing disciplinary measures to combat school harassment [17] and adjusting teaching hours to align with children's psychomotor abilities are fundamental norms that need integration into the Moroccan educational system to eradicate dropout rates.\n\nHowever, these measures should not infringe upon the crucial role of teachers or diminish their authority and expectations. Teachers are indispensable linchpins in the educational chain within the school environment. Consequently, teacher motivation plays a pivotal role and is necessary for student learning in school [29].\n\nTo support these efforts, school principals must establish and enforce rules and procedures to manage the school environment effectively. Simultaneously, they should remain attentive to the needs of their staff, particularly teachers, and strive to improve staff management.\n\nPrioritizing the well-being of teachers within educational settings is crucial. Enhancing their quality of life, including autonomy, attentive listening, and adequate compensation, would positively affect their performance. Teacher training [10, 28] should be given priority and tailored to meet the specific needs of educators. A teacher who lacks knowledge of motivational pedagogy and child or adolescent psychology may struggle to effectively manage their classroom or address some students' learning or behavioral difficulties. Teacher training should be scheduled annually or at the beginning of each school year, guided by an analysis of the needs of educators. Sharing skills and expertise could draw inspiration from successful foreign educational models spanning preschool, primary, and secondary schools.\n\nEducating teachers about adopting the appropriate attitude toward students at different stages of their academic journey, from their first day in school to adolescence, requires benevolence and social capital investments by teachers [6, 30]. Studies have highlighted the significance of teacher support [31] during dropout and in achieving student success [32]. Positive relationships between students and their teachers [29, 31] promote student well-being and learning. Conversely, a correlation exists between school dropout and antisocial behavior [12], particularly in a classroom climate with difficulty in teacher-student relationships [12].\n\nHence, a careful selection process for teachers becomes imperative. Recruiters should consider essential personality traits such as emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness [33], along with an awareness of the Big Five [34] personality traits when evaluating potential educators. However, it is equally crucial for students to show respect and courtesy toward their teachers. In cases of disciplinary issues within the classroom, administrators must apply appropriate disciplinary measures [10] to curtail misconduct within the institution, upholding the teacher's role. Regardless of the actor or sector involved, whether teacher or student, in the private or public sphere, impurity leads to victimization and fosters an environment unsuitable for teaching and the performance of individuals [35]. In the same vein, addressing school deficiencies and implementing an anti-bullying policy [17] would necessitate deploying human resources and tools to support students facing difficulties.\n\nWhile well-informed teachers are responsible for identifying students facing challenges, it is crucial to acknowledge that the root cause of declining academic performance may lie elsewhere. In this regard, students' learning difficulties often require teachers to reevaluate their pedagogical approach, their relationship with students [29], and the curriculum design while also considering the psychological component of the student. Other factors may be at play, necessitating an exploration of barriers to comprehension and knowledge acquisition. As risk factors can vary based on a student's personality and character, it falls upon the school community to identify early indicators and tailor interventions while recognizing the unique qualities of each student.\n\nFor this reason, a multidisciplinary team comprising teachers, school assistants, and school psychologists should investigate the primary sources of difficulties, including motor skills, information processing, memory, and attention. A thorough assessment is imperative, whether the challenges manifest as comprehension issues, attention deficits, concentration problems, memory lapses, or other difficulties. These difficulties may sometimes be exacerbated within the school environment due to noise, disruptions, or feelings of suffocation.\n\nFurthermore, subject difficulty and an overloaded curriculum can genuinely impede understanding. In other cases, students may grapple with severe learning problems such as listening difficulties or dyslexia, aggressive behavior disorders (violence), delinquent tendencies, and depressive states. When detected within a school, these symptoms should be handled with care, as they can serve as precursors to school dropout [11]. Identifying the source of the problem, rather than resorting to false judgments or stigmatization, is crucial. In this regard, there is a correlation between low academic performance and school harassment, mistreatment of students [17], absentecism, and concentration difficulties. Recent studies [28] underscore the significance of teachers' caring attitudes and quality of life in maintaining student engagement, influencing classroom performance, and shaping dropout decisions [36].\n\nIn addition to the challenges observed within the school environment, external factors related to students' socioeconomic background also play a significant role. The institution often accommodates students from disadvantaged backgrounds who face barriers to their educational journey due to recurring setbacks. Sociological research [9] has emphasized the link between socioeconomic background and academic outcomes. According to investigations [37], academic delays and premature school dropout tend to be more prevalent and pronounced among students from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nIn this context, some families [12] may struggle with dysfunction and fail to provide their children with economic and financial support, among other reasons. In most cases, the precariousness and instability of their circumstances can affect their children's academic progress.\n\nThe challenges a group of students faces, spanning all educational levels, have necessitated new requirements that schools must adapt to. Moreover, schools now require assistance and can no longer claim a monopoly on pedagogical and educational actions without enlisting the support of qualified professionals who can work with vulnerable or disadvantaged families.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe genuine solutions to combat school dropout must now shift their focus toward prevention within the school environment rather than dealing with the consequences of dropout. Elevating the quality of life within schools, eradicating all forms of violence that students may face, and establishing specialists in psychoeducation are the key remedies to engage students in their education and support them throughout their academic journey.\n\nAcknowledging that a young dropout does not make this decision in isolation is crucial. The educational institution they attend may inadvertently play a role in their decision by subjecting them to subtle forms of violence over time. When schools fail to identify and promptly address their students' difficulties and shortcomings, they risk pathologizing these differences and outsourcing their management.\n\nIn many cases, dropping out represents a form of avoidance, a last resort, and an act of self-defense. Furthermore, a student labeled or perceived as weak may eventually choose to exit the school system. The new problematic student archetype becomes the dropout. Outside the school system, these individuals may revol against the entire system, making them susceptible to various forms of deviance and often extremism.\n\nThe challenges a group of students faces across all educational levels necessitate adaptations within schools. The school must now seek assistance and can no longer claim a monopoly on educational action without implementing new measures. It must engage specialized actors, such as school psychologists and assistants, who can lay the groundwork and establish connections with vulnerable and fragmented families.\n\nEducation is no longer solely about imparting knowledge, such as reading and arithmetic; it also encompasses teaching children life skills, discipline, values, and morals. A student from an underprivileged family requires dignity, courage, and motivation to persevere in their studies despite difficulties. However, the problem arises when the child lacks support, and the void they encounter while transitioning between different environments (from school to home) makes them susceptible to various forms of deviance. This transition is often abrupt, particularly from primary to secondary school.\n\nStudents accustomed to close teacher-student relationships during primary school, where homework assignments were regularly given, may find themselves unprepared for the increased independence required in secondary school. This stage demands greater maturity and a more benevolent approach from teachers. When students face indifference from educators, they may feel adifft, underscoring the need for consistent support within this demographic.\n\nIn situations where schools aim to reestablish connections with certain parents, particularly those from precarious or challenging backgrounds, the situation's complexity becomes apparent. This prompts the question: Who is the most qualified actor to effectively bridge and support the student, family, and school system?\n\nDealing with such demands, teachers alone cannot handle the numerous pedagogical, psychological, and cognitive requirements. Psychologists and school assistants can contribute significantly to managing students facing difficulties within the school environment. Their intervention can prevent sudden interruptions in schooling or placements in specialized schools.\n\nAdapting the current educational system to meet these overarching requirements is not just a theoretical concept but an urgent necessity. The diverse range of difficulties and challenges encountered in schools involves parameters encompassing the psychological, relational, cognitive, and emotional domains. As a result, successful interventions necessitate different and specialized profiles. When the school becomes a place that children genuinely appreciate, it will undoubtedly excel in minimizing the toll of violence suffered by students within its walls. Establishing an innovative educational system that prioritizes the quality of life and personalized support for the educational community in addressing issues of violence harassment, and remedying school deficiencies would greatly enhance the school's ability to retain its students.\n\nConceptualization, MH and HK; methodology, MH; software, DA; validation, HK; writing--original draft preparation, MH; writing--review and editing, MH and DA; supervision, HK.

As prematurely leaving school carries profound consequences, it encompasses far-reaching social, economic, and psychological implications. Governments across various nations, including Morocco, have implemented anti-dropout initiatives [1].\n\nHowever, a critical oversight remains regarding risk factors inherent within the school environment, teacher-student dynamics, and immediate surroundings. One notable but often overlooked contributor to school dropout is the presence of mistreatment and bullying within educational institutions [2]. Contrary to the prevailing misconception, dropout cannot be solely attributed to academic failure, learning difficulties, intellectual challenges, or adverse living conditions. This misconception places undue responsibility on the student and their family, framing dropout as a voluntary choice rather than a circumstance they endure [3].\n\nIt is essential to recognize that this perspective predominates in urban areas, diverging from rural regions of the Kingdom. In rural settings, 74% of children are engaged in work, driven by the need to financially support themselves and their families [2]. Economic constraints force these young individuals into early employment, making education a secondary consideration. Additionally, in suburban areas and specific towns in the south, early marriages further compound the challenges faced by the female population, obstructing their educational aspirations [2].\n\nIn alternative scenarios, some students engage in a conscious dropout process motivated by a perceived lack of significance in their education. This phenomenon manifests as academic demobilization, characterized by waning interest in their studies [3]. In such instances, individuals actively discontinue their schooling, prioritizing paid employment over academic pursuits. Their decision is rooted in the belief that the benefits derived from work outweigh the perceived value of continued education [3].\n\nNonetheless, various forms of violence, including bullying, stigmatization, the labeling of students with below-average academic performance, an unsupportive teacher attitude, a sense of impunity regarding disciplinary measures, and instances of victimization, serve as compelling factors propelling students to prematurely exit the educational system [2]. Despite the government's concerted efforts to address the issue, persistently high dropout rates underscore the inadequacy of these interventions [1].\n\nStatistics reveal that the implemented measures predominantly concentrate on post-dropout scenarios, lacking a proactive approach and neglecting efforts to enhance the overall quality of school life. Consequently, the intended objectives have not been fully realized, highlighting the critical need for interventions prioritizing prevention and establishing a positive school environment [1].\n\n_Intervention by specialists: School psychologists and school assistance_\n\nOur proposed hypothesis contends that dropping out of school can be seen as a form of violence and aggression, aligning with the Frustrations-Aggression Theory [1]. According to this hypothesis, students experience this aggression when educational institutions lack or fail to utilize the necessary resources to retain and nurture them (see Figure 1). Essentially, premature departure from the school system is conceptualized as a manifestation of school violence directed against the individual who decides to discontinue their education. In light of these observations, the early detection and intervention in cases of violence or difficulties experienced by students in school, facilitated by psychoeducational specialists and teachers, could significantly enhance the ability to meet students' expectations and prevent school dropout. Proactively identifying issues and targeted support and intervention can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment. Boredom, behavioral problems, violence, depression, and demotivation serve as indicators of distress within the school environment national statistics underscore the alarming prevalence of school dropout, which poses a substantial threat to the education of young people.\n\nFigure 1: Conceptualization of the school dropout process in Moroccan schools across all levels, particularly in college.\n\nFigure 2 reveals fluctuations in school dropout rates, showing non-linearity over the years. This observation characterizes school dropout as a complex and elusive phenomenon despite the concerted efforts of the Ministry of Education in Morocco. Notably, there was an increase in school dropout during the 2014-2015 school year, followed by a decrease in the subsequent year, with a significant decline between the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years.\n\nFigure 2: Dropout rates in Moroccan primary education.\n\n However, a notable surge occurred in the 2018-2019 academic year, followed by a slight decrease in the 2019-2020 academic year. It is evident that the decline witnessed from 2015 to 2018 was substantial.\n\nThe graph depicted in Figure 3 illustrates a significant trend in college dropouts. In the academic year 2014-2015, there were a substantial number of dropouts, totaling 181,609, with 68,586 female students. Subsequently, there was a modest decline in dropout rates from 2015 to 2017. However, beginning in 2017 and extending to 2019, the dropout rates experienced an upward trajectory. Notably, in the academic year 2019-2020, there was a notable surge in dropouts, with 57,573 among female students and a total of 160,837.\n\nThe graph presented in Figure 4 provides insights into dropout rates in secondary education, specifically in qualifying studies. The peak occurred in the 2014-2015 academic year, with 126,288 dropouts, including 58,456 females. Subsequently, there was a decline in these numbers in the 2015-2016 academic year, with 102,664 dropouts in total and 43,976 among female students. In the following year, 2016-2017, the numbers further decreased to 85,608 in total, with 37,412 among girls. However, the phenomenon exhibited non-linear variations, as an increase in dropout numbers was recorded in the 2017-2018 academic year, reaching a total of 93,315 and an increase among female students, totaling 39,420. Conversely, in 2018-2019, there was a shift towards a decline in dropout numbers, resulting in 80,565 total, with 33,725 among girls (Figure 4).\n\nHowever, what remains intriguing is the shift in the figures recorded during the academic year 2019-2020 (see Figure 4). Notably, this period marked the onset of the pandemic, accompanied by adopting a part-time study system involving three days of study per week with reduced hours. The total enrollment for this year stands at 67,134, including 27,271 girls. This data suggests the possibility that the introduction of the three-day study week, as opposed to the conventional six days, may have contributed to meeting the expectations of students, fostering a sense of reduced stress and increased comfort in their academic lives.\n\nFigure 4: Secondary education dropout rates.\n\nFigure 3: College dropout rates.\n\n Nonetheless, dropout rates are most pronounced at the college level, as highlighted by some authors [4]. Early warning signs must be detected to prevent potential student dropouts. These signs often manifest during the college years when students must adapt to a significantly different educational format than that of elementary school. Among these precursors to dropout are sensations of boredom, loss of interest [3], frequent absences, and recurring academic difficulties, which should be identified as soon as they surface.\n\nNevertheless, the phenomenon of dropout varies among students. While not formally leaving school, some experience demobilization due to disengagement from the educational process, classifying them as passive dropouts [5] and gradually moving away from active participation in their education.\n\nThe explanations for the dropout phenomenon reveal that it results from a disconnect and lack of alignment between the student's interactions and relationships within their school and family environments. Often, conflicting values and constraints between these two spheres create turmoil for the student. In this context, dropout becomes a consequence of the socialization difficulties experienced by the student, leading to the deterioration of the link between the young person, the school, and society [6]. In other cases, leaving the school system is the culmination of a gradual loss of interest in education, often compounded by untreated factors related to the student's personality [6,7].\n\nThis dichotomy highlights internal and external risk factors specific to the child and their immediate environment. However, the emphasis should be placed on the student's struggle to adapt independently to two contradictory environments.\n\nThe process of dropping out of school is characterized as a gradual progression [7], drawing attention to the stages that lead to this behavior. Consequently, before the actual act of leaving school occurs, the child may exhibit several discernible symptoms. In classifying dropout typologies, variables related to this behavior manifest at varying intensities from one student to another. These variables encompass antisocial behavior, deviance, and even the emergence of behavioral disorders [3,8], which may escalate to extreme violence, declining academic performance [8], and depression. While commonalities exist among potential dropouts, each case remains unique.\n\nFurthermore, students from modest socioeconomic backgrounds or facing financial hardships [9], marked by precarious living conditions and underachievement in elementary school, are more likely to adopt this behavior. Additionally, students with disabilities [10] can be considered as hidden dropouts. In other instances, characterizing dropouts by psychological traits, including indicators from tests, correlates with the risk of dropping out [11]. These traits encompass aggressive behavior disorders (school violence), delinquency, and depressive states.\n\nRecognition of these factors underscores the credibility of the process-oriented perspective on school dropout. This conceptual framework equips psycho-educators to promptly identify psychological reactions in learners and take timely intervention measures. Importantly, it acknowledges that violence and dropout issues can stem from within the school environment rather than solely originating from external sources such as family or acquaintances. Students exhibiting such behaviors typically share a common thread of experiencing difficulties. In cases where families exert minimal control and display weak cohesion, specialized psychological and educational support becomes crucial, particularly when students may exhibit elevated levels of depression [12].\n\nHowever, even disciplined students with no apparent problems may encounter learning difficulties and fail examinations. Their academic underperformance may not necessarily be attributed to mental retardation or a movement disorder. Consequently, addressing their academic progress would require a pedagogical approach tailored to their pace and cognitive capacities. Failure to implement such measures ad hoc increases the risk of dropouts [3].\n\nTherefore, boredom and a search for meaning within the school environment may persist even among students with commendable academic performance. For these students, the school may appear as an incoherent setting, marked by limited order and organization in the classroom. Notably, despite their academic success, these individuals exhibit an elevated rate of depression [3], underscoring the impact of the school environment on their mental well-being.\n\nThese students also tend to harbor a negative perception of parental and familial emotional support in general [3]. At school, their disappointment arises from the inability to find adequate psychological support, especially from teachers or a multidisciplinary team, to bridge the emotional gap they perceive on both fronts. Conversely, manifestations of violent behavior or aggressiveness [3] can serve as indicators of an impending dropout, with recurrent aggression exhibited at higher intensities than their peers. Educational psychology highlights the connection between violence and school dropout through aggressive behavior disorders, delinquent tendencies, and depressive states [3]. Failure to recognize and address these symptoms within the school environment increases the likelihood of dropout.\n\n_Unpunished school violence and slippage contribute to student dropout_\n\nThe escalation of violence within educational institutions has drawn the attention of both sociologists and educational psychologists, who have identified various forms of violence [13]. At the elementary school level, micro-violence is often witnessed among children, where harm is typically unintentional due to their age. In contrast, middle and high school environments witness more intentional and premeditated forms of violence, encompassing physical, verbal, and psychological aspects. Alarmingly, statistics indicate that approximately one in three children have experienced at least one of these forms and suffered its consequences. In 2017, the Moroccan Ministry of Education initiated collaboration with UNESCO on School Life and Violence, shedding light on the prevalence of physical and verbal violence, with boys being more frequent perpetrators. This trend is particularly pronounced in college-level education, which coincides with the sensitive period of adolescence. The primary causes attributed to school violence are predominantly social and often linked to family issues [14,15].\n\nSanctions for deviant behavior vary depending on each school's regulations and the severity of the transgressions committed. Child aggressors displaying antisocial behavior are typically subjected to temporary exclusion, lasting from a few days to several weeks. However, research on disengaged dropouts [3] has indicated that punitive measures such as suspension, expulsion, and other disciplinary actions are ineffective. In fact, these children often become more prone to violence and repeat their offenses. This approach to discipline not only exacerbates educational backwardness but also contributes to demotivation.\n\nMoreover, these young individuals persist in their behaviors while enduring stigmatization, feeling a deep sense of shame that prevents them from confronting the often-contemptuous gaze of their peers. The prevailing punitive model [3] perpetuates this cycle of judgment and shame, raising a critical question: could this punitive approach alone be a significant factor in the decision to drop out of school?\n\nIn many instances, students are left to face school violence, whether psychological, physical, or verbal, on their own. Repeated attacks on students, coupled with their eventual resignation, contribute to an ongoing cycle of harassment. The entire class may align against the targeted student, creating an environment where the school atmosphere deteriorates, and the victim endures daily harassment, cyberbullying, and even sexual harassment [16].\n\nTo illustrate one of many scenarios within the school context, classmates may subject a student to relentless harassment. Additionally, violence endured by students may not always be reported to the administration by adults, resulting in no disciplinary actions taken against the perpetrators of mistreatment.\n\nBeyond the school premises, students may become subjects of mockery and face the risk of collective aggression by their peers. Physical assaults may occur in various locations, including locker rooms, hallways, yards, transportation, or even in the school cafeteria. The student may endure pushing, beating, and mistreatment from others.\n\nHarassers, recognizing the harm inflicted on their victims, often employ covert tactics to avoid the vigilance of adults. Therefore, it becomes imperative for schools to have an anti-bullying policy [17] in place, coupled with the quality of the policy's content [18], to effectively prevent victimization.\n\nIn most cases, victims of harassment choose to endure their suffering in silence rather than reporting it to their parents. They fear parental rejection, damage to their pride, and a potential blow to their self-esteem. However, clinical signs [17,19], such as sleep difficulties, bedwetting, headaches, stomachaches, neck or back pain, can alert parents or loved ones to potential harassment. In addition to physical signs like strangulation, bloodshot eyes, and bruises, children may display other indicators both at school and at home. At school, their academic performance may significantly decline. The child may cease to complete homework, arrive without necessary materials, and pretend to have forgotten them when, in reality, they are unusable due to aggression. These conditions greatly affect concentration levels, leading to a considerable drop in performance. Anxiety and psychosomatic problems [17] may poison the student's memory as they anticipate further bullying.\n\nAt home, the child may exhibit irritability and an excessive fixation on video games or their phone. Other anxiety-related somatic symptoms, such as sleep or eating disorders, episodes of crying, and depressive tendencies [20], may emerge in children. These signs should be regarded as warning signals. Consequently, many children attempt to escape these difficulties by avoiding the situation, resulting in accumulative delays and absences.\n\nIn the short term, the consequences of this violence can hinder a student's intellectual development and academic success. Over time, this discomfort can lead many children to drop out. In the long term, depressive tendencies [20] may manifest in some, along with an inability to engage socially and even suicidal tendencies [19,21]. When a child is placed in an institution that recognizes their symptoms and facilitates genuine communication and support between the teacher [16] and the psycho-pedagogical team, they can be salvaged.\n\n_A stigmatizing school environment and stereotypes surrounding school failure can constitue significant forms of violence against students_\n\nThe deterioration of academic performance is frequently cited as a common characteristic of dropouts and one of the most potent predictors, mainly when it occurs early [3,11,22,23]. Students facing academic challenges often find themselves condemned both at school and at home, with little effort made to understand the underlying causes of their academic struggles.\n\nChildren with lower academic achievement can experience stigmatization [17], labeling, and relegation to the bottom ranks within the school setting. This often occurs when teachers prioritize their attention toward studious and disciplined students, who frequently occupy the front rows of the classroom.\n\n At home, students at risk of dropping out often encounter judgment from parents and relatives who equate school failure with failure in life. For parents, their child's academic struggles can challenge their perception of being good parents, leading to heightened anxiety and exaggerated reactions. Instead of engaging constructively with the school and relevant stakeholders or providing encouragement, some parents exacerbate the situation by perpetuating conflicts and continually demeaning and blaming their children.\n\nThe combined impact of parental and school-related abuse can ultimately disorient the child. Consequently, for a young person who perceives themselves as socially insignificant or useless, dropping out may be seen as an act of rebellion or a quest for meaning and identity elsewhere, potentially leading to delinquency [3] and extremism. Psychologically, the uncertainty about the dropout's future can manifest as emotional distress, which some may attempt to cope with through avoidance or substance abuse [3] like drugs or alcohol.\n\nA disruption in education or a lack of academic achievement can severely jeopardize a young person's prospects for professional integration, social status, identity, and future autonomy. As a result, dropouts face heightened challenges in striving for professional stability. Without strong qualifications or diplomas, they often find themselves in precarious employment situations, uncertain about their future. In Morocco, this contributes to the prolonged dependence of youth on their family structures, with a substantial 82% of young individuals still residing with at least one parent, even into adulthood.\n\nIn some cases, the label of \"dropout\" not only identifies the student as someone who left school prematurely but also as a problematic individual. This social representation, or stereotype, vividly illustrates the damaging impact of stigma within schools. Conversely, students perceived as problematic may receive social labels that push them towards a deviant path. Similarly, categorizing students based on cognitive performance becomes a significant risk factor for school dropout.\n\nFrequently, students are classified as either academically strong or weak. These labels can persist, with children internalizing and identifying with the given label within the school environment. The degree of acceptance of these labels often depends on their frequency and the source's authority. Unintentionally, teachers may contribute to reinforcing these distinctions by consistently selecting only high-achieving students for various activities. Consequently, the public nature of labeling perpetuates its institutionalization, further increasing the dropout risk. Raising awareness among teachers about the necessity to avoid labeling, especially through training [20], is crucial.\n\nFor some girls, early pregnancies often result in dropping out [6, 24]. This is why the government has implemented policies to facilitate their return to education and training. In Morocco, concrete and immediate emergency plans were initiated by the government in May 2018 to address the issue of school dropouts.\n\nRegarding safety, the social consequences of dropping out can be substantial. On one hand, idleness resulting from leaving school may contribute to increased social violence and risky behavior. On the other hand, out-of-school students are twice as likely to face unemployment, engage in delinquent activities such as theft, resort to a life of crime, and use drugs [9]. In certain cases, dropping out is linked to an elevated risk of suicide [19, 21], while in other instances, these young individuals may become victims of acts of extremism and radicalization [7].\n\n_The \"Pygmalion Effect\": Impact of teacher expectations on student progress_\n\nAs elucidated by numerous authors [25], the Pygmalion effect elucidates the interplay between a teacher's expectations and students' academic performance. When a teacher maintains a positive outlook, particularly a positive a priori, students tend to be more motivated and achieve better results. Conversely, if a teacher holds negative preconceptions about a student or their class, it can harm academic performance, potentially decreasing their achievements. Often, this influence may go unnoticed by the teacher, making it imperative to be particularly attuned to the teacher's perception and its impact on a child's behavior within the educational realm.\n\nNeuroscience advances support lifelong learning [26], contingent on the learner's self-confidence, self-esteem, and motivation. The human brain exhibits plasticity, continuing to develop throughout one's life for learning [26]. It suggests that students inherently possess the potential for high academic performance, provided their environment, school, and education foster their development and enhance their latent capabilities.\n\nIn this context, examining factors contributing to disparities in social achievements and educational outcomes, particularly among children, has been a topic of interest in social psychology. Debates have revolved around the relative impact of heredity versus environment as determining factors for success. Studies have shown that the environment is crucial to real-world success [27]. Specifically, a child raised in a nurturing environment with balanced parental and familial support is more likely to succeed than a child whose parents have relinquished their involvement, especially when the school does not sufficiently assume the role of education and guidance. Similarly, exposing children to diverse leisure activities and fostering open, attentive communication can contribute to their success. Paradoxically, an educational deficit can hinder a child's development and cognitive abilities, even if they are intellectually gifted.\n\nTeachers may ponder several questions: Beyond academic education, does the student experience a quality of life and opportunities for personal growth and educational enrichment through sports and other activities? _Dropout as an aggressive behavior stemming from student frustration_\n\nIn summary, considering the elements discussed above, it is important to confirm the hypothesis that a young dropout is not solely responsible for their decision to leave school. Various factors, including subtle forms of violence such as harassment, criticism, and stigmatization related to educational difficulties, may gradually contribute to their choice to drop out. The act of dropping out can be seen as a manifestation of aggressive behavior, a consequence of the accumulated frustrations (Frustrations-Aggression Theory [1]) experienced by the student throughout their educational journey.\n\nNumerous studies underscore a significant correlation between school dropout and experiences of violence [10, 17]. This underscores a gap in the prevailing perception of the phenomenon, as some attribute the issue more to the student and their family.\n\nThe experience of dropping out may vary among students, with some being compelled by external factors while others actively and voluntarily choose to discontinue their education. For some, leaving school early is perceived as a rational decision, considering the cost-risk-benefit dynamics, especially when they do not find meaning in their academic pursuits.\n\nHowever, regardless of the origins and sources of this phenomenon, it unfolds within the educational framework. Therefore, engaging students exhibiting risky behaviors or underlying, and apparent difficulties is crucial. On the other hand, a preventative and intervention system addressing violence and school dropout in Morocco can be implemented proactively before the actual act of dropping out occurs.\n\n_Implementing a comprehensive anti-dropout prevention strategy: Ecosystem-level school transformation_\n\nTo address the pressing issue of school dropout, schools must regain their central role in education and student development. State-of-the-art teacher training and cultivating a caring attitude [28] toward students is paramount. These efforts are essential to rectify educational deficiencies through early detection and tailored guidance for each student.\n\nPrevention strategies should encompass the involvement of the psychoeducational team and parents. Research on dropout rates [6] has confirmed that peer mentoring is one of the most cost-effective tools for dropout prevention. Additionally, implementing disciplinary measures to combat school harassment [17] and adjusting teaching hours to align with children's psychomotor abilities are fundamental norms that need integration into the Moroccan educational system to eradicate dropout rates.\n\nHowever, these measures should not infringe upon the crucial role of teachers or diminish their authority and expectations. Teachers are indispensable linchpins in the educational chain within the school environment. Consequently, teacher motivation plays a pivotal role and is necessary for student learning in school [29].\n\nTo support these efforts, school principals must establish and enforce rules and procedures to manage the school environment effectively. Simultaneously, they should remain attentive to the needs of their staff, particularly teachers, and strive to improve staff management.\n\nPrioritizing the well-being of teachers within educational settings is crucial. Enhancing their quality of life, including autonomy, attentive listening, and adequate compensation, would positively affect their performance. Teacher training [10, 28] should be given priority and tailored to meet the specific needs of educators. A teacher who lacks knowledge of motivational pedagogy and child or adolescent psychology may struggle to effectively manage their classroom or address some students' learning or behavioral difficulties. Teacher training should be scheduled annually or at the beginning of each school year, guided by an analysis of the needs of educators. Sharing skills and expertise could draw inspiration from successful foreign educational models spanning preschool, primary, and secondary schools.\n\nEducating teachers about adopting the appropriate attitude toward students at different stages of their academic journey, from their first day in school to adolescence, requires benevolence and social capital investments by teachers [6, 30]. Studies have highlighted the significance of teacher support [31] during dropout and in achieving student success [32]. Positive relationships between students and their teachers [29, 31] promote student well-being and learning. Conversely, a correlation exists between school dropout and antisocial behavior [12], particularly in a classroom climate with difficulty in teacher-student relationships [12].\n\nHence, a careful selection process for teachers becomes imperative. Recruiters should consider essential personality traits such as emotional stability, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness [33], along with an awareness of the Big Five [34] personality traits when evaluating potential educators. However, it is equally crucial for students to show respect and courtesy toward their teachers. In cases of disciplinary issues within the classroom, administrators must apply appropriate disciplinary measures [10] to curtail misconduct within the institution, upholding the teacher's role. Regardless of the actor or sector involved, whether teacher or student, in the private or public sphere, impurity leads to victimization and fosters an environment unsuitable for teaching and the performance of individuals [35]. In the same vein, addressing school deficiencies and implementing an anti-bullying policy [17] would necessitate deploying human resources and tools to support students facing difficulties.\n\nWhile well-informed teachers are responsible for identifying students facing challenges, it is crucial to acknowledge that the root cause of declining academic performance may lie elsewhere. In this regard, students' learning difficulties often require teachers to reevaluate their pedagogical approach, their relationship with students [29], and the curriculum design while also considering the psychological component of the student. Other factors may be at play, necessitating an exploration of barriers to comprehension and knowledge acquisition. As risk factors can vary based on a student's personality and character, it falls upon the school community to identify early indicators and tailor interventions while recognizing the unique qualities of each student.\n\nFor this reason, a multidisciplinary team comprising teachers, school assistants, and school psychologists should investigate the primary sources of difficulties, including motor skills, information processing, memory, and attention. A thorough assessment is imperative, whether the challenges manifest as comprehension issues, attention deficits, concentration problems, memory lapses, or other difficulties. These difficulties may sometimes be exacerbated within the school environment due to noise, disruptions, or feelings of suffocation.\n\nFurthermore, subject difficulty and an overloaded curriculum can genuinely impede understanding. In other cases, students may grapple with severe learning problems such as listening difficulties or dyslexia, aggressive behavior disorders (violence), delinquent tendencies, and depressive states. When detected within a school, these symptoms should be handled with care, as they can serve as precursors to school dropout [11]. Identifying the source of the problem, rather than resorting to false judgments or stigmatization, is crucial. In this regard, there is a correlation between low academic performance and school harassment, mistreatment of students [17], absentecism, and concentration difficulties. Recent studies [28] underscore the significance of teachers' caring attitudes and quality of life in maintaining student engagement, influencing classroom performance, and shaping dropout decisions [36].\n\nIn addition to the challenges observed within the school environment, external factors related to students' socioeconomic background also play a significant role. The institution often accommodates students from disadvantaged backgrounds who face barriers to their educational journey due to recurring setbacks. Sociological research [9] has emphasized the link between socioeconomic background and academic outcomes. According to investigations [37], academic delays and premature school dropout tend to be more prevalent and pronounced among students from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nIn this context, some families [12] may struggle with dysfunction and fail to provide their children with economic and financial support, among other reasons. In most cases, the precariousness and instability of their circumstances can affect their children's academic progress.\n\nThe challenges a group of students faces, spanning all educational levels, have necessitated new requirements that schools must adapt to. Moreover, schools now require assistance and can no longer claim a monopoly on pedagogical and educational actions without enlisting the support of qualified professionals who can work with vulnerable or disadvantaged families.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe genuine solutions to combat school dropout must now shift their focus toward prevention within the school environment rather than dealing with the consequences of dropout. Elevating the quality of life within schools, eradicating all forms of violence that students may face, and establishing specialists in psychoeducation are the key remedies to engage students in their education and support them throughout their academic journey.\n\nAcknowledging that a young dropout does not make this decision in isolation is crucial. The educational institution they attend may inadvertently play a role in their decision by subjecting them to subtle forms of violence over time. When schools fail to identify and promptly address their students' difficulties and shortcomings, they risk pathologizing these differences and outsourcing their management.\n\nIn many cases, dropping out represents a form of avoidance, a last resort, and an act of self-defense. Furthermore, a student labeled or perceived as weak may eventually choose to exit the school system. The new problematic student archetype becomes the dropout. Outside the school system, these individuals may revol against the entire system, making them susceptible to various forms of deviance and often extremism.\n\nThe challenges a group of students faces across all educational levels necessitate adaptations within schools. The school must now seek assistance and can no longer claim a monopoly on educational action without implementing new measures. It must engage specialized actors, such as school psychologists and assistants, who can lay the groundwork and establish connections with vulnerable and fragmented families.\n\nEducation is no longer solely about imparting knowledge, such as reading and arithmetic; it also encompasses teaching children life skills, discipline, values, and morals. A student from an underprivileged family requires dignity, courage, and motivation to persevere in their studies despite difficulties. However, the problem arises when the child lacks support, and the void they encounter while transitioning between different environments (from school to home) makes them susceptible to various forms of deviance. This transition is often abrupt, particularly from primary to secondary school.\n\nStudents accustomed to close teacher-student relationships during primary school, where homework assignments were regularly given, may find themselves unprepared for the increased independence required in secondary school. This stage demands greater maturity and a more benevolent approach from teachers. When students face indifference from educators, they may feel adifft, underscoring the need for consistent support within this demographic.\n\nIn situations where schools aim to reestablish connections with certain parents, particularly those from precarious or challenging backgrounds, the situation's complexity becomes apparent. This prompts the question: Who is the most qualified actor to effectively bridge and support the student, family, and school system?\n\nDealing with such demands, teachers alone cannot handle the numerous pedagogical, psychological, and cognitive requirements. Psychologists and school assistants can contribute significantly to managing students facing difficulties within the school environment. Their intervention can prevent sudden interruptions in schooling or placements in specialized schools.\n\nAdapting the current educational system to meet these overarching requirements is not just a theoretical concept but an urgent necessity. The diverse range of difficulties and challenges encountered in schools involves parameters encompassing the psychological, relational, cognitive, and emotional domains. As a result, successful interventions necessitate different and specialized profiles. When the school becomes a place that children genuinely appreciate, it will undoubtedly excel in minimizing the toll of violence suffered by students within its walls. Establishing an innovative educational system that prioritizes the quality of life and personalized support for the educational community in addressing issues of violence harassment, and remedying school deficiencies would greatly enhance the school's ability to retain its students.\n\nConceptualization, MH and HK; methodology, MH; software, DA; validation, HK; writing--original draft preparation, MH; writing--review and editing, MH and DA; supervision, HK.

Defining the mechanisms of this control may be key to understanding how to replicate this functional cure in others.\n\n**Methods** In ECs and untreated non-EC patients, we compared IFN\\(\\alpha\\) serum concentration, distribution of immune cell subsets, and frequency of cell markers associated with immune dysfunction. We also investigated the effect of an elevated dose of IFN\\(\\alpha\\) on distinct subsets within dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and CD4+ and CD8 + T cells.\n\n**Results** Serum IFN\\(\\alpha\\) was undetectable in ECs, but all immune cell subsets from untreated non-EC patients were structurally and functionally impaired. We also show that the altered phenotype and function of these cell subsets in non-EC patients can be recapitulated when cells are stimulated in vitro with high-dose IFN\\(\\alpha\\).\n\n**Conclusions** Elevated IFN\\(\\alpha\\) is a key mediator of HIV pathogenesis.\n\n+\nFootnote \u2020: inhibiting IL-7-induced T cell proliferation, controlling T cell homeostasis'. They then emerge at the initiation phase of the adaptive immune response by inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+T helper cells', followed by their effects on T cell differentiation into suppressive IL-10-Tr1 cells[43]. Systemic IFNa (type I IFN) and mucosal IFN-lambda (IFN) (type III IFN) both exert antiviral activities via IFN-stimulated genes[11], although with different kinetics of gene induction and distinct cell targets expressing specific receptors. IFNARI and IFNAR are constitutively expressed on virtually all nucleated cells, such as CD4+T cells, whereas at homeostasis, IFN receptors are constitutively expressed on epithelial cells and only in a selected pool of immune cells[12]. Consequently, in inflammatory HIV lymphoid tissues, elevated IFNa locally hampers CD4+T helper and CD4+T cellular T helper cell function and thus inhibits the initiation phase of the anti-HIV adaptive immune response, leading to the development of HIV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Even at a high level, IFNa does not hamper CD4+T cell-induced initiation of the immune response. Of note, a 2023 report characterized the efficacy of therapeutic administration of IFN in patients in the early stages of COVID-19[13].\n\nThe conclusion that elevated IFNa is a central mediator of HIV pathogenesis is supported by previous findings and the current results. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in IFN type 1 and type 3 pathways as contributing to variable responses to HIV infection[14]. In addition, SIV-infected African green monkeys do not express elevated levels of IFNa and do not develop AIDS[15]. In contrast, SIV-infected rhesus macaques develop AIDS and have high serum IFNa[49]. Results from the EURIS phase 2B placebo-controlled clinical trial, carried out in five hospital centers from 1996-1998 in 240 patients who had not received combined ART, were based on anti-IFNa antibody induction in an active vaccine approach to lower IFNa. All study endpoints were met among vaccine responders, including a lower occurrence of HIV-related events, improved CD4+T cell counts, and reduced viral load correlating with the rise of anti-IFNa antibodies[17]. Finally, we show here that IFNa induces a series of immune cell abnormalities in untreated non-EC patients.\n\nWe find that untreated patients with HIV (non-ECs) have abnormally high concentrations of serum IFNa and a high frequency of phenotypic alterations in all immune cell types. These alterations are known effects of IFNa. In contrast, ECs show minimal abnormal immune cell alterations. We further identify potential immune mechanisms enabling each EC to control viral replication through individual immune capacity. Finally, we hypothesize that EC control of IFNa is at least partially circumstantial, relying on infection with only a low dose of HIV. Because IFNa levels in the primary phase of the acute infection correlate with virus titer, we propose that the critical chain of events in uncontrolled virus replication in non-ECs is a vicious cycle of HIV \\(\\rightarrow\\) IFNa \\(\\rightarrow\\) more HIV \\(\\rightarrow\\) elevated IFNa \\(\\rightarrow\\) more HIV, and so on. In an accompanying manuscript, we described the mechanism leading to this ongoing cycle[1].\n\n## Methods\n\n### Human samples\n\nA total of 73 Healthy donor (HD) samples were obtained through Eablissement Francais du Sang (EFS, Paris, France). Fifty-one samples were used for serological analysis and 22 for phenotypic analysis. A total of 48 people living with HIV were recruited and subdivided into two groups: ECs (\\(n=18\\)), from the Natural Viral Suppressors Cohort (Baltimore), and non-ECs (\\(n=30\\)), from the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda \\(n=19\\)) and from the Laboratoire de Reference SIDA (Liege \\(n=11\\)). Patient groups did not significantly differ in terms of age, gender, or disease status. All participants provided informed consent in accordance with protocols approved by the regional ethical research boards and the Declaration of Helsinki (H-29331 (USA) and 2020/418 (Belgium). Clinical data are given in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n### Sample processing\n\nPeripheral blood and serum were collected into appropriate tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, St Quentin en Yvelines, France). PBMCs were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen.\n\n### Cell culture\n\nCD4+T cells were isolated from frozen PBMCs. All CD4+T cells were positively selected with a CD4+T cell isolation kit (Miltersi Biotec, Germany), yielding CD4+T cell populations at a purity of 996-999. Purified CD4+T cells were stimulated with a \\(\\upmu\\)g/mL. plate-bound anti-human CD3 (QKT3) monoclonal antibody (mAb; Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) and 4 mg/mL soluble anti-human CD28 (CD28.2) mAb (Becton Dickinson, Le Pont De Claira France) in the presence of recombinant human IL-2 (Proleukaine, Chiron, Amsterdam, 100 (U/mL) and recombinant human interferon alpha-2a (Refore-A) and IFN2) (Biotechne, UK) at the indicated dose\". After 5 days of culture, CD38 and CD25 expression and the frequency of 7-AAD+ cells were measured by flow cytometry on stimulated CD4+T cells. Natural killer (NK) cells were isolated from PBMCs. NK cells were negatively selected with the NK cell isolation kit (Miltersi Biotec, Germany), yielding NK cell populations at a purity of 96-99%. NK cells were stimulated with IL-15 (Miltenyi Biotec, 10 mg/mL), IL-2 (Proleukaine, Chiron, Amsterdam 100 U/mL), and recombinant human interferon alpha-2a (Refore-A) at the indicated dose. After 3 days of culture, expression of CD56, CD95, and NKG2D was measured by flow cytometry (Supplementary Table 2a).\n\n### Antibody panels, staining, and flow cytometry analysis\n\nImmunophenotypic studies were performed on frozen samples, using flow cytometry panels with up to 23 colors. Approximately \\(1\\times 10^{6}\\) to \\(5\\times 10^{7}\\) frozen PBMCs were used per patient per stain. Staining was performed as follows, except for the panel using HLA-E or HLA-A*(202 pentamers (Proimmune). PBMCs were thawed using RPMI supplemented with 20% FCS per standard protocol. Cells were resuspended in 45 \\(\\upmu\\)L. FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA). To block Fc receptor binding, 5 \\(\\upmu\\)L of FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) was added to the cells for 10 minutes at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before the staining. Staining was performed in several stages, depending on the number of antibodies. The first mAb cocktail for surface staining, prepared with brilliant turbody, brilliant violet, and brilliant blue antibodies in Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences, Paris, France), was added to the cells, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C (see Supplementary Table 2 for antibody panel information). Cells were washed once with FACS buffer before the second mAb cocktail was added, which contained all other antibodies in FACS buffer for surface staining and viability staining, followed by further incubation for 30 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. When needed, cells were fixed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 Staining Buffer Set (eBioscience, Paris, France) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then stained for intracellular targets with the third mAb cocktail in the kit's permeabilization buffer. After incubation, cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and FACS buffer. When using HLA-E or HLA-A*02 pentamers (ProImmune), pre-incubation with a blocking anti-CD94 mAb (clone HP-3D9, 5 ug/mL, BD Biosciences) was performed to completely abrogate the non-specific staining of CD94+/NKG2+T cells by HLA-E pentamers before the staining with the other antibodies. Before use within this panel, all antibodies were titrated individually to identify the concentration that provided the maximal brightness of the positive cell population and the lowest signal for the negative cell population. Cells were acquired on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer. Data were analysed using FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC). Flow cytometry data were identified as the proportion (%) of cells expressing the marker, and protein levels as median fluorescence intensity. The gating strategy used to identify the immune cell subtypes and their respective subsets is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1. Unsupervised analyses were performed using Cytobank software and R studio software.\n\n### 7-AAD (7-amino-actinomycin D) staining\n\nApoptosis of stimulated CFD-labeled CD4+T cells was determined using the 7-AAD assay[11]. Briefly, cultured cells were stained with 20 ug/mL nuclear dye 7-AAD (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. FSC/7-AAD dot plots distinguish living (FSC\\({}^{\\rm{th}}\\)/7-AAD\\(-\\)) from apoptotic (FCShigh/7-AAD\\(+\\)) cells and apoptotic bodies (FSClow/7-AAD\\(-\\)) and debris (FSClow/7-AAD\\(-\\)). Living cells were identified as CD3\\({}^{+}\\)7-AAD\\(-\\)FSC\\({}^{+}\\) cells.\n\n### CellTrace violet staining\n\nCD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells and NK cells were stained with 1 mM dye (CellTrace violet; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) in PBS for 8 min at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C at a concentration of \\(1\\times 10^{4}\\) cells/mL. The labeling was stopped by washing the cells twice with RPMI-1640 culture medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were then resuspended at the desired concentration and subsequently used for proliferation assays.\n\n### Composite cell phenotypic alteration score\n\nWe generated a cumulative phenotypic score for each T cell subset. The frequency of the following markers was used to calculate the score: CD25\\({}^{-}\\), CD26\\({}^{+}\\), HLA-DR\\({}^{+}\\), CD38\\({}^{+}\\), CTLA-4\\({}^{+}\\), CD28\\({}^{-}\\), PD1\\({}^{+}\\), and CD39\\({}^{+}\\). The score is calculated as the sum of the ratio of the expression level of each marker to the average expression level of the corresponding marker in HDs.\n\n### Cytokine quantification\n\nSerrum IFNa and IFNa2 levels were determined using SIMOA cytokine assays (references 100860 and 101419, respectively). Van der Sluis et al. showed that HIV infection of co-cultures of CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells and pDCs enhances mRNA expression of IFNa2 and not IFNa1 or IFNa3, so we focused only on serum IFNa2 levels [31]. IL-10 in 4-day cell culture supernatants was determined by Luminer technology (human custom Procarta Plex, Invitrogen).\n\n### Statistics and reproducibility\n\nComparisons between the two groups were made using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Multiple group comparisons were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison testing, Error bars on graphs represent interquartile ranges. Correlations were assessed using the nonparametric Spearman test. Analyses were performed with GraphPadP Prism and R. A two-sided \\(p\\) value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant (ns: not significant; *\\(p<0.05\\); **\\(p<0.01\\); ***\\(p<0.001\\); ***\\(p<0.0001\\)).\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\nAs detailed in the methods, in untreated non-ECs, ECs, and HDs, we compared IFNa and IFNa2 serum concentration, the distribution of immune cell subsets, and the frequency of cell markers associated with immune dysfunction. These endpoints include abnormal expression of checkpoint receptors or molecules controlling immune cell function such as inhibitory checkpoint receptors (PD1, CTLA-4) that lead cells to the exhaustion stage [21]; cell receptor markers of activation/differentiation (CD25/CD38/HLA-DR) associated with chronic immune activation [35]; checkpoint receptors controlling pericellular levels of immunosuppressive adenosine (CD39 centoude-ideases, CD26 harboring adenosine deaminase) [36]; apoptotic cell receptors (CD95); and soluble suppressive mediators (IL-10). This phenotypic study focuses particularly on cytotoxic NK cells, HLA-1a-(B)-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cells, and HLA-1b-(E)-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) suppressive cells (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supps). Of interest, CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells, which lyase abnormal CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells expressing HIV peptides in the HLA-E-restricted context, also are present in other chronic inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases [35]; cancer [38], and other microbial infections [37].\n\n### IFNa is elevated in HIV-infected non-ECs and modifies the distribution of blood immune cell types\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) of blood immune cell type distribution among non-ECs, ECs, and HDs shows that non-ECs and HDs cluster apart, whereas ECs overlap with both of the other groups (Fig. 1a). Figure 1b, c show the distinct proportion of circulating immune cell types in non-ECs, ECs, and HDs. We find that the serum concentration of IFNa but not of IFNa2 is abnormally increased in non-ECs compared with HDs and the large majority of ECs (Fig. 1d). We also find a positive correlation between IFNa2 and IFNa serum levels in ECs but not in non-EC patients (Fig. 1eI). Moreover, serum IFNa2 concentration is negatively associated with CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell frequency and positively associated with CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell frequency in non-ECs (Fig. 1eI, eII).\n\nElevated IFNa induces an abnormal frequency and phenotypic alterations of NK cells and other innate cell types in non-ECs but not in ECs\n\nNK cells are a heterogeneous population of immune cells [39], as SPADE analysis (Fig. 2aI) and dot plots (Fig. 2aII) demonstrate. As previously reported [39], we find that non-ECs have fewer early and mature NK cells than do HDs (2.58 vs 4.61% and 48.1 vs 83.2%, respectively), and many more terminal NK cells (17.91 vs 2.84%) (Fig. 2aII). ECs and HDs have similar proportions of NK cell subsets. In the mature NK subset, the activating markers Helios, natural cytotoxicity receptors, and GrzB/perf are less frequent in non-ECs than in ECs and HDs (Fig. 2bI, bII). Inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) bind HIV peptides present on HLA-1b in activated CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells as well as the inhibitory checkpoint receptors PD1 or CD39, leading cells to an exhaustion-like status [21]. We find that iKIRs are overexpressed in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Fig. 2bIII, IV). Of note, CD38 and HLA-DR are prevalent in non-EC mature NK cells. In addition, IFNa levels correlate positively with the frequency of iKIR \\({}^{+}\\) mature NK cells (Fig. 2cI), terminal NK cells (Fig. 2cI), and iKIR\\({}^{+}\\) terminal NK cells (Fig. 2cII). This finding is consistent with the concept that IFNa enhances the development of non-functional NK cells. Furthermore, indicative of loss of function among NK cells in non-ECs, we find that the activation marker NKG2D is only weakly expressed on early NK cells (Fig. 2dI) in this group and that the apoptotic marker CD95 is highly expressed on mature NK cells (Fig. 2dII), respectively reducing their cytotoxic activity and increasing their propensity to apoptosis.\n\nTo investigate whether elevated IFNa induces these altered NK cell subset distribution and surface phenotypes, we treated in vitro-purified NK cells with increasing doses of IFNa. We find that elevated IFNa inhibits NK cell viability and proliferation capability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2eI, eII). Furthermore, elevated IFNa reduces CD56 expression in CD56\\({}^{\\rm{linux}NK}\\) cells (Fig. 2eII), leading to a decrease in the frequency of mature NK cells and a concomitant increase in the percentage of terminal NK cells (Fig. 2eIV). The addition of increasing amounts of IFNa to NK cell culture induces a dose-dependent decrease in NKG2D expression in early NK cells (Fig. 2eV) and an increase in CD95 expression in mature NK cells (Fig. 2eV). In summary, elevated IFNa levels can, in large part, induce the NK cell abnormalities observed in non-ECs.\n\nRegarding other innate immune cells, the frequency of CD11\\({}^{+}\\)/CD123\\({}^{+}\\) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) is lower in non-ECs than in ECs (13.4 versus 32.5%, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This observation was previously made by others [39]. \\(\\sqrt{\\text{T}}\\) cells show an abnormally high expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors in non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The expression of these checkpoint receptors, including CD88\\({}^{+}\\)/ and HLA-DR\\({}^{+}\\), is triggered directly by IFNa and indirectly by loss of CD26\\({}^{+}\\).\n\n### Elevated IFNa alters immune cell homeostasis in non-ECs compared with HDs and a majority of ECs\n\nHomostostatic disturbances of T cell subsets after HIV infection are hallmarks of early disease. From our investigation of the maintenance of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells in the three groups, as anticipated, we observe a lower frequency of both T cell subsets in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Supplementary Fig. 2cI, cII). In addition, we find negative correlations between CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) central memory (CM) T cell frequency and serum IFNa levels in HIV patients (ECs + non-ECs) (Supplementary Fig. 2eIII, cIV). This result reflects the pathogenic inhibitory effects of IFNa on IL-7-induced homeostatic T cell proliferation [39] in CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)T cells homing to lymph nodes [3]. Interestingly, even though the frequency of EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), CDS\\({}^{+}\\)CM cells is similar to that of HDs, the frequency of EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\). CDS\\({}^{+}\\)CM cells is reduced, albeit to a lesser degree than in non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 2Cv and Table 1). The maintenance of T cell homeostasis observed in EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), but not in EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\) cases (Table 1) may be accounted for by the homology between HLA\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), and NK iKR (specifically the 3D1L allele) sharing the bad serotype. Therefore, iKR\\({}^{+}\\) NKs do not recognize HLA\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\) peptide epitopes, and NK cell killing is not inhibited, which enables the unaltered EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), iKR\\({}^{+}\\) NK cell lysis of infected CD\\({}^{+}\\) T cells, resulting in reduced viral load and a correlated IFN\\({}_{\\text{NA}}\\) production level [4].

SPADE analysis done on conventional T cells (Tconv, Fig. 3aI) and histograms (Fig. 3aII) show a varied frequency of their subtypes in both non-ECs and ECs compared with HDs. Both ECs and non-ECs have significantly lower frequencies of naive CD4\\({}^{*}\\)T cells compared with HDs. ECs have higher frequencies of CMs and effector memory (EM) T cells that re-express CD45RA (TEMRAS), and non-ECs have higher frequencies of CMs and effector memoryfrequencies of EM and TEMRA cells (Fig. 3aII). Our exploration of changes in activation/exhausduction phenotypes in CD\\({}^{4}\\)+T cell subsets in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs shows that the absence (CD26, CD25, CD28) or increase (CD38, HLA-HD, CD39, PDI, and CTLA-4) of these markers is linked to an exhaustion-like state associated with lack of function [27].

Furthermore, we find positive correlations between expression levels of different abnormally expressed markers studied in the CD4'CM cells in non-ECs, but we do not observe these correlations in ECs (Supplementary Fig. 3d).\n\nWe then investigated the circulating CXCR5'CD45RO'CD4' T follicular helper cells (\\(\\varsigma\\)Tfh) that govern B cell hypersonatic mutation and Ig isotype permutation in follicular lymph nodes. Compared with HDs, non-ECs have a lower frequency of fTh cells, and on these cells, they have a lower CXCR5 expression level and higher coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3aV). In addition, a similar frequency of CD19'B cells is seen between HDs and non-ECs, but non-ECs have a reduced percentage of CXCR5'B cells, which in turn have lower expression of CXCR5 (Fig. 3aV). As for the regulatory CD4'T cell subset (CD4' Foxp3'), their frequency and function are altered in non-ECs but not in ECs (Fig. 3b). Their proportion is increased in non-ECs (Fig. 3b, bll), and the percentage of non-functional CD25' regulatory T cell (Treg) variants19 is enhanced (Fig. 3bIII, bIV). Once again, serum IFNa level significantly correlates with this alteration (Fig. 3bV). In addition, multiple memory CD4'T free phenotypic abnormalities are associated with IFNa in non-ECs, but these abnormalities are less numerous in ECs (Fig. 3bVI).\n\nIn a similar analysis of CD8'T cells in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs, we examined four well-defined CD8'T cell subsets as described above for the Tconv. We find distinct distributions of CD8'T cell subsets in the three groups, as viSNE analysis (Fig. 4aI) and histograms (Fig. 4aII) show. Both ECs and non-ECs have a significantly lower frequency of naive CD4'T cells compared with HDs. Non-ECs also have fewer CM cells and more EM and TEMRA cells than do HDs and ECs (Fig. 4aI). As for the Tconv subsets, each CD8'T cell subset has a distinct pattern of phenotypic alterations in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Fig. 4aII,aIV). Non-EC CM and TEMRA cells have a higher phenotypic alteration score than these cells do in ECs (Fig. 4aV). IFNa induces a large majority of these inhibitory checkpoint receptors (Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, as described in Fig. 4aVI, in non-ECs, we find positive correlations between expression levels of the various studied markers in CD8'CM cells. CD8' HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells consist of effector HLA-1a-restricted CTLs and HLA-E-restricted CD8'supps carrying iKHs, the human analog of iY49, which characterize murine CD8'supp cells23-23. HLA-1a-(B)- and HLA-1b-(E)-presenting HIV peptide tetramers recognize CTLs (Fig. 4bI) and CD8'supps (Fig. 4bI), respectively. Using this pattern, we distinguish and phenotypically characterize the two types of cytotoxic CD8'T cells: CTLs (CD8', TEMRA, GrzB/perf\\({}^{\\pm}\\), iKIR\\({}^{+}\\), Helios\\({}^{-}\\)) and CD8'supps (CD8', TEMRA, GrzB/perf\\({}^{\\pm}\\), iKIR\\({}^{+}\\), Helios\\({}^{-}\\)). We find similar CTL frequencies in ECs and non-ECs (81.05 vs 74.1595) (Fig. 4bIII), but the inhibitory checkpoint receptor level is significantly higher in non-ECs than in ECs and HDs (Fig. 4bV), in keeping with the effect of elevated IFNa. This change leads to greater CTL activity in ECs. For the CD8'supp cells, non-ECs have a slightly higher percentage of these cells than do ECs (25.85 vs 18.95%) (Fig. 4bIV), with a more pronounced exhaustion-like stage (CD8, CD39, HLA-DR) or downregulated markers (CD26) (Fig. 4bVI), all of which IFNa can induce. Of note, similar to the CTL cells, the CD8'supp cell frequency in ECs is variable from one individual to another.\n\nFootnote 23: The \\(\\Delta\\) on thymic stromal cells, which occur during early infection in the innate phase of the immune response, and as reported, also are induced by IFNa[39].\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe conclude that besides circulating HIV, the key mediator of AIDS development is elevated circulating IFNa. The main criteria for establishing a central major mediator of pathogenesis are that it should be active in the earliest days of infection (i.e., in the innate immune phase), be elevated and circulating, and have broad pathogenic effects. The findings show that IFNa meets these criteria. In non-ECs, it circulates at elevated levels, inducing immune cell type abnormalities linked to poor immune cell function (Figs. 1-5 and Table 1). Correspondingly, in ECs, an absence of high\n\nFig. 5: **Distinct immune cell phenotypic patterns between non-B57 and B57 ECs with an individual profile displayed by each patient in these subgroups.**\n\n**a** Comparative analysis of NK cells, CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T-cell subset distribution in non-B57 and B57 ECs.

Based on documented experimental data, we propose that ECs avoid the pathogenic vicious cycle of high HIV \\(\\rightarrow\\) high IFNa \\(\\rightarrow\\) more \\(\\mathrm{HIV}\\rightarrow\\) pathogenic IFNa. We draw this inference based on four key findings, elaborated below.\n\nFirst, at infection onset, NK cells play a critical role in ECs but not in non-ECs. These cells live target cells before the viral setpoint and thus are likely the most effective immune factor reducing viral load and correlated IFNa levels at onset. The differences between NK cells from ECs and non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 6) lie in their functional capacity. Non-EC NK cells expressing multiple inhibitory receptors, including iKH and checkpoint receptors such as PDI, are likely not functional (Fig. 20B1I, IV and Table 1). Moreover, the low expression of iKIR in NK cells from EC\\({}_{837+}\\) enables these unaltered cells to lyse infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells expressing HLA\\({}_{837-}\\)restricted HIV epitopes, whereas EC\\({}_{837-}\\) NK cells expressing iKIR (Fig. 5B1I), III compensate for this inhibitory signal by expressing the activating NKG2C receptor (Fig. 5BIII), enabling lysis of HLA-E-restricted infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells.\n\nThe second key finding is that IFNa-induced impairment of 7-induced immune cell homeostasis in non-ECs results in the reduction of NK, CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells. As a consequence, populations of helper and cytotoxic T cells define during the later adaptive immune response. The third finding is that the hampered IFNa-induced initiation of the adaptive immune response in non-ECs results in diminished CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell activation and proliferation (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Finally, in non-ECs, inhibition of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cell function linked to IFNa-induced inhibitory checkpoints results in loss of control of viral replication (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\nThe consortium of collaborators working on the ECs has postulated a possible immune mechanism enabling control of HIV replication in ECs\\({}^{3}\\) (Fig. 5). In keeping with this concept, we find that in addition to evidence supporting our hypothesis of a putative lower infectious inoculum, each EC exhibited one or more distinct immune mechanisms (Table 1) that could contribute to the avoidance of elevated IFNa levels. These mechanisms include early lysis of infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells by phenotypically unaltered NK cells and during the adaptive immune response by cytotoxic CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. These data prompted us to consider that EC status does not depend solely on one specific genetic or immune cell profile but also on a distinct immune capacity that is peculiar to each EC case and likely additional circumstantial factors, such as a low inoculum size. There is no doubt that early contributing factors for NK lysis include HLA presentation of HIV peptides by infected cells, including the known HLA\\({}_{837+}\\), and HLA-E, following the adaptive immune response for CTL or CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. It also is clear that the HLA\\({}_{837}\\) genotype is insufficient to account for EC status, as not all ECs are HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) and HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) is present in up to 11% of patients with progressive disease, similar to what is seen in the uninfected white population\\({}^{+}\\). In keeping with Altfeld et al.\\({}^{+}\\), we suggest that HIV evasion of the cytotoxic NK cell-mediated immune response is far more deleterious for early control of viral replication than are CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells, which are effective only during the adaptive immune response. Considering that ECs do not exhibit many immune mechanisms in non-ECs related to elevated IFNa caused by HIV disruption (Table 1), we propose that a fortuitous low infectious inoculum is an important contributor to EC status. This hypothesis involves several associated predictions now under analysis.\n\nWith a comprehensive characterization of the pathogenic levels of IFNa during both the anti-HIV innate and adaptive immune reactions, we identify elevated IFNa as the key mediator of HIV inhibition of immune cell attack in non-ECs and show how ECs naturally block HIV replication by avoiding elevated IFNa. These findings suggest that reducing IFNa production by any acceptable and efficient means could convert non-ECs to ECs. This proposal is further supported by work carried out in HIV-infected humanized mice showing that anti-IFNa treatment reduces HIV proximal DNA by 14-fold in spleen cells and 7-fold in bone marrow cells\\({}^{+}\\). In an accompanying manuscript, we describe the mechanism of how an inefficient anti-HIV immune response promotes progressive elevation of IFNa\\({}^{16}\\).\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data for the main figures in the manuscript can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25125377\\({}^{\\text{\\textregistered}}\\).\n\nReceived: 3 May 2023; Accepted: 7 February 2024; Published online: 19 March 2024\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Deeks, S.

Defining the mechanisms of this control may be key to understanding how to replicate this functional cure in others.\n\n**", "Methods": "** In ECs and untreated non-EC patients, we compared IFN\\(\\alpha\\) serum concentration, distribution of immune cell subsets, and frequency of cell markers associated with immune dysfunction.

They then emerge at the initiation phase of the adaptive immune response by inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+T helper cells', followed by their effects on T cell differentiation into suppressive IL-10-Tr1 cells[43]. Systemic IFNa (type I IFN) and mucosal IFN-lambda (IFN) (type III IFN) both exert antiviral activities via IFN-stimulated genes[11], although with different kinetics of gene induction and distinct cell targets expressing specific receptors. IFNARI and IFNAR are constitutively expressed on virtually all nucleated cells, such as CD4+T cells, whereas at homeostasis, IFN receptors are constitutively expressed on epithelial cells and only in a selected pool of immune cells[12]. Consequently, in inflammatory HIV lymphoid tissues, elevated IFNa locally hampers CD4+T helper and CD4+T cellular T helper cell function and thus inhibits the initiation phase of the anti-HIV adaptive immune response, leading to the development of HIV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Even at a high level, IFNa does not hamper CD4+T cell-induced initiation of the immune response. Of note, a 2023 report characterized the efficacy of therapeutic administration of IFN in patients in the early stages of COVID-19[13].\n\nThe conclusion that elevated IFNa is a central mediator of HIV pathogenesis is supported by previous findings and the current results. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in IFN type 1 and type 3 pathways as contributing to variable responses to HIV infection[14]. In addition, SIV-infected African green monkeys do not express elevated levels of IFNa and do not develop AIDS[15]. In contrast, SIV-infected rhesus macaques develop AIDS and have high serum IFNa[49]. Results from the EURIS phase 2B placebo-controlled clinical trial, carried out in five hospital centers from 1996-1998 in 240 patients who had not received combined ART, were based on anti-IFNa antibody induction in an active vaccine approach to lower IFNa. All study endpoints were met among vaccine responders, including a lower occurrence of HIV-related events, improved CD4+T cell counts, and reduced viral load correlating with the rise of anti-IFNa antibodies[17].

They then emerge at the initiation phase of the adaptive immune response by inhibiting the proliferation of CD4+T helper cells', followed by their effects on T cell differentiation into suppressive IL-10-Tr1 cells[43]. Systemic IFNa (type I IFN) and mucosal IFN-lambda (IFN) (type III IFN) both exert antiviral activities via IFN-stimulated genes[11], although with different kinetics of gene induction and distinct cell targets expressing specific receptors. IFNARI and IFNAR are constitutively expressed on virtually all nucleated cells, such as CD4+T cells, whereas at homeostasis, IFN receptors are constitutively expressed on epithelial cells and only in a selected pool of immune cells[12]. Consequently, in inflammatory HIV lymphoid tissues, elevated IFNa locally hampers CD4+T helper and CD4+T cellular T helper cell function and thus inhibits the initiation phase of the anti-HIV adaptive immune response, leading to the development of HIV-specific neutralizing antibody responses. Even at a high level, IFNa does not hamper CD4+T cell-induced initiation of the immune response. Of note, a 2023 report characterized the efficacy of therapeutic administration of IFN in patients in the early stages of COVID-19[13].\n\nThe conclusion that elevated IFNa is a central mediator of HIV pathogenesis is supported by previous findings and the current results. Genetic studies have identified polymorphisms in IFN type 1 and type 3 pathways as contributing to variable responses to HIV infection[14]. In addition, SIV-infected African green monkeys do not express elevated levels of IFNa and do not develop AIDS[15]. In contrast, SIV-infected rhesus macaques develop AIDS and have high serum IFNa[49].

These endpoints include abnormal expression of checkpoint receptors or molecules controlling immune cell function such as inhibitory checkpoint receptors (PD1, CTLA-4) that lead cells to the exhaustion stage [21]; cell receptor markers of activation/differentiation (CD25/CD38/HLA-DR) associated with chronic immune activation [35]; checkpoint receptors controlling pericellular levels of immunosuppressive adenosine (CD39 centoude-ideases, CD26 harboring adenosine deaminase) [36]; apoptotic cell receptors (CD95); and soluble suppressive mediators (IL-10). This phenotypic study focuses particularly on cytotoxic NK cells, HLA-1a-(B)-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cells, and HLA-1b-(E)-restricted CD8\\({}^{+}\\) suppressive cells (CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supps). Of interest, CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells, which lyase abnormal CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells expressing HIV peptides in the HLA-E-restricted context, also are present in other chronic inflammatory diseases, including autoimmune diseases [35]; cancer [38], and other microbial infections [37].\n\n### ", "IFNa is elevated in HIV-infected non-ECs and modifies the distribution of blood immune cell types": "\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) of blood immune cell type distribution among non-ECs, ECs, and HDs shows that non-ECs and HDs cluster apart, whereas ECs overlap with both of the other groups (Fig. 1a). Figure 1b, c show the distinct proportion of circulating immune cell types in non-ECs, ECs, and HDs. We find that the serum concentration of IFNa but not of IFNa2 is abnormally increased in non-ECs compared with HDs and the large majority of ECs (Fig. 1d). We also find a positive correlation between IFNa2 and IFNa serum levels in ECs but not in non-EC patients (Fig. 1eI). Moreover, serum IFNa2 concentration is negatively associated with CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell frequency and positively associated with CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cell frequency in non-ECs (Fig. 1eI, eII).\n\nElevated IFNa induces an abnormal frequency and phenotypic alterations of NK cells and other innate cell types in non-ECs but not in ECs\n\nNK cells are a heterogeneous population of immune cells [39], as SPADE analysis (Fig. 2aI) and dot plots (Fig. 2aII) demonstrate. As previously reported [39], we find that non-ECs have fewer early and mature NK cells than do HDs (2.58 vs 4.61% and 48.1 vs 83.2%, respectively), and many more terminal NK cells (17.91 vs 2.84%) (Fig. 2aII). ECs and HDs have similar proportions of NK cell subsets. In the mature NK subset, the activating markers Helios, natural cytotoxicity receptors, and GrzB/perf are less frequent in non-ECs than in ECs and HDs (Fig. 2bI, bII). Inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) bind HIV peptides present on HLA-1b in activated CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells as well as the inhibitory checkpoint receptors PD1 or CD39, leading cells to an exhaustion-like status [21]. We find that iKIRs are overexpressed in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Fig. 2bIII, IV). Of note, CD38 and HLA-DR are prevalent in non-EC mature NK cells. In addition, IFNa levels correlate positively with the frequency of iKIR \\({}^{+}\\) mature NK cells (Fig. 2cI), terminal NK cells (Fig. 2cI), and iKIR\\({}^{+}\\) terminal NK cells (Fig. 2cII). This finding is consistent with the concept that IFNa enhances the development of non-functional NK cells. Furthermore, indicative of loss of function among NK cells in non-ECs, we find that the activation marker NKG2D is only weakly expressed on early NK cells (Fig. 2dI) in this group and that the apoptotic marker CD95 is highly expressed on mature NK cells (Fig. 2dII), respectively reducing their cytotoxic activity and increasing their propensity to apoptosis.\n\nTo investigate whether elevated IFNa induces these altered NK cell subset distribution and surface phenotypes, we treated in vitro-purified NK cells with increasing doses of IFNa. We find that elevated IFNa inhibits NK cell viability and proliferation capability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2eI, eII). Furthermore, elevated IFNa reduces CD56 expression in CD56\\({}^{\\rm{linux}NK}\\) cells (Fig. 2eII), leading to a decrease in the frequency of mature NK cells and a concomitant increase in the percentage of terminal NK cells (Fig. 2eIV). The addition of increasing amounts of IFNa to NK cell culture induces a dose-dependent decrease in NKG2D expression in early NK cells (Fig. 2eV) and an increase in CD95 expression in mature NK cells (Fig. 2eV). In summary, elevated IFNa levels can, in large part, induce the NK cell abnormalities observed in non-ECs.\n\nRegarding other innate immune cells, the frequency of CD11\\({}^{+}\\)/CD123\\({}^{+}\\) plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) is lower in non-ECs than in ECs (13.4 versus 32.5%, respectively) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). This observation was previously made by others [39]. \\(\\sqrt{\\text{T}}\\) cells show an abnormally high expression of inhibitory checkpoint receptors in non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The expression of these checkpoint receptors, including CD88\\({}^{+}\\)/ and HLA-DR\\({}^{+}\\), is triggered directly by IFNa and indirectly by loss of CD26\\({}^{+}\\).\n\n### ", "Elevated IFNa alters immune cell homeostasis in non-ECs compared with HDs and a majority of ECs": "\n\nHomostostatic disturbances of T cell subsets after HIV infection are hallmarks of early disease. From our investigation of the maintenance of CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells in the three groups, as anticipated, we observe a lower frequency of both T cell subsets in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Supplementary Fig. 2cI, cII). In addition, we find negative correlations between CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) central memory (CM) T cell frequency and serum IFNa levels in HIV patients (ECs + non-ECs) (Supplementary Fig. 2eIII, cIV). This result reflects the pathogenic inhibitory effects of IFNa on IL-7-induced homeostatic T cell proliferation [39] in CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)T cells homing to lymph nodes [3]. Interestingly, even though the frequency of EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), CDS\\({}^{+}\\)CM cells is similar to that of HDs, the frequency of EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\). CDS\\({}^{+}\\)CM cells is reduced, albeit to a lesser degree than in non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 2Cv and Table 1). The maintenance of T cell homeostasis observed in EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), but not in EC\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\) cases (Table 1) may be accounted for by the homology between HLA\\({}_{\\text{BS7}^{+}}\\), and NK iKR (specifically the 3D1L allele) sharing the bad serotype.

Error bars on graphs represent interquartile ranges.\n\n one key HIV pathogenic mediator: the effect of elevated IFNa in non-ECs. Furthermore, we find positive correlations between expression levels of different abnormally expressed markers studied in the CD4'CM cells in non-ECs, but we do not observe these correlations in ECs (Supplementary Fig. 3d).\n\nWe then investigated the circulating CXCR5'CD45RO'CD4' T follicular helper cells (\\(\\varsigma\\)Tfh) that govern B cell hypersonatic mutation and Ig isotype permutation in follicular lymph nodes. Compared with HDs, non-ECs have a lower frequency of fTh cells, and on these cells, they have a lower CXCR5 expression level and higher coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR (Fig. 3aV). In addition, a similar frequency of CD19'B cells is seen between HDs and non-ECs, but non-ECs have a reduced percentage of CXCR5'B cells, which in turn have lower expression of CXCR5 (Fig. 3aV). As for the regulatory CD4'T cell subset (CD4' Foxp3'), their frequency and function are altered in non-ECs but not in ECs (Fig. 3b). Their proportion is increased in non-ECs (Fig. 3b, bll), and the percentage of non-functional CD25' regulatory T cell (Treg) variants19 is enhanced (Fig. 3bIII, bIV). Once again, serum IFNa level significantly correlates with this alteration (Fig. 3bV). In addition, multiple memory CD4'T free phenotypic abnormalities are associated with IFNa in non-ECs, but these abnormalities are less numerous in ECs (Fig. 3bVI).\n\nIn a similar analysis of CD8'T cells in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs, we examined four well-defined CD8'T cell subsets as described above for the Tconv. We find distinct distributions of CD8'T cell subsets in the three groups, as viSNE analysis (Fig. 4aI) and histograms (Fig. 4aII) show. Both ECs and non-ECs have a significantly lower frequency of naive CD4'T cells compared with HDs. Non-ECs also have fewer CM cells and more EM and TEMRA cells than do HDs and ECs (Fig. 4aI). As for the Tconv subsets, each CD8'T cell subset has a distinct pattern of phenotypic alterations in non-ECs compared with ECs and HDs (Fig. 4aII,aIV). Non-EC CM and TEMRA cells have a higher phenotypic alteration score than these cells do in ECs (Fig. 4aV). IFNa induces a large majority of these inhibitory checkpoint receptors (Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, as described in Fig. 4aVI, in non-ECs, we find positive correlations between expression levels of the various studied markers in CD8'CM cells. CD8' HIV-specific cytotoxic T cells consist of effector HLA-1a-restricted CTLs and HLA-E-restricted CD8'supps carrying iKHs, the human analog of iY49, which characterize murine CD8'supp cells23-23. HLA-1a-(B)- and HLA-1b-(E)-presenting HIV peptide tetramers recognize CTLs (Fig. 4bI) and CD8'supps (Fig. 4bI), respectively. Using this pattern, we distinguish and phenotypically characterize the two types of cytotoxic CD8'T cells: CTLs (CD8', TEMRA, GrzB/perf\\({}^{\\pm}\\), iKIR\\({}^{+}\\), Helios\\({}^{-}\\)) and CD8'supps (CD8', TEMRA, GrzB/perf\\({}^{\\pm}\\), iKIR\\({}^{+}\\), Helios\\({}^{-}\\)). We find similar CTL frequencies in ECs and non-ECs (81.05 vs 74.1595) (Fig. 4bIII), but the inhibitory checkpoint receptor level is significantly higher in non-ECs than in ECs and HDs (Fig. 4bV), in keeping with the effect of elevated IFNa. This change leads to greater CTL activity in ECs. For the CD8'supp cells, non-ECs have a slightly higher percentage of these cells than do ECs (25.85 vs 18.95%) (Fig. 4bIV), with a more pronounced exhaustion-like stage (CD8, CD39, HLA-DR) or downregulated markers (CD26) (Fig. 4bVI), all of which IFNa can induce. Of note, similar to the CTL cells, the CD8'supp cell frequency in ECs is variable from one individual to another.\n\nFootnote 23: The \\(\\Delta\\) on thymic stromal cells, which occur during early infection in the innate phase of the immune response, and as reported, also are induced by IFNa[39].\n\n## Discussion\n\nWe conclude that besides circulating HIV, the key mediator of AIDS development is elevated circulating IFNa. The main criteria for establishing a central major mediator of pathogenesis are that it should be active in the earliest days of infection (i.e., in the innate immune phase), be elevated and circulating, and have broad pathogenic effects. The findings show that IFNa meets these criteria. In non-ECs, it circulates at elevated levels, inducing immune cell type abnormalities linked to poor immune cell function (Figs. 1-5 and Table 1). Correspondingly, in ECs, an absence of high\n\nFig. 5: **Distinct immune cell phenotypic patterns between non-B57 and B57 ECs with an individual profile displayed by each patient in these subgroups.**\n\n**a** Comparative analysis of NK cells, CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T-cell subset distribution in non-B57 and B57 ECs.

Based on documented experimental data, we propose that ECs avoid the pathogenic vicious cycle of high HIV \\(\\rightarrow\\) high IFNa \\(\\rightarrow\\) more \\(\\mathrm{HIV}\\rightarrow\\) pathogenic IFNa. We draw this inference based on four key findings, elaborated below.\n\nFirst, at infection onset, NK cells play a critical role in ECs but not in non-ECs. These cells live target cells before the viral setpoint and thus are likely the most effective immune factor reducing viral load and correlated IFNa levels at onset. The differences between NK cells from ECs and non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 6) lie in their functional capacity. Non-EC NK cells expressing multiple inhibitory receptors, including iKH and checkpoint receptors such as PDI, are likely not functional (Fig. 20B1I, IV and Table 1). Moreover, the low expression of iKIR in NK cells from EC\\({}_{837+}\\) enables these unaltered cells to lyse infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells expressing HLA\\({}_{837-}\\)restricted HIV epitopes, whereas EC\\({}_{837-}\\) NK cells expressing iKIR (Fig. 5B1I), III compensate for this inhibitory signal by expressing the activating NKG2C receptor (Fig. 5BIII), enabling lysis of HLA-E-restricted infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells.\n\nThe second key finding is that IFNa-induced impairment of 7-induced immune cell homeostasis in non-ECs results in the reduction of NK, CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells. As a consequence, populations of helper and cytotoxic T cells define during the later adaptive immune response. The third finding is that the hampered IFNa-induced initiation of the adaptive immune response in non-ECs results in diminished CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell activation and proliferation (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Finally, in non-ECs, inhibition of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cell function linked to IFNa-induced inhibitory checkpoints results in loss of control of viral replication (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\nThe consortium of collaborators working on the ECs has postulated a possible immune mechanism enabling control of HIV replication in ECs\\({}^{3}\\) (Fig. 5). In keeping with this concept, we find that in addition to evidence supporting our hypothesis of a putative lower infectious inoculum, each EC exhibited one or more distinct immune mechanisms (Table 1) that could contribute to the avoidance of elevated IFNa levels. These mechanisms include early lysis of infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells by phenotypically unaltered NK cells and during the adaptive immune response by cytotoxic CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. These data prompted us to consider that EC status does not depend solely on one specific genetic or immune cell profile but also on a distinct immune capacity that is peculiar to each EC case and likely additional circumstantial factors, such as a low inoculum size. There is no doubt that early contributing factors for NK lysis include HLA presentation of HIV peptides by infected cells, including the known HLA\\({}_{837+}\\), and HLA-E, following the adaptive immune response for CTL or CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. It also is clear that the HLA\\({}_{837}\\) genotype is insufficient to account for EC status, as not all ECs are HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) and HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) is present in up to 11% of patients with progressive disease, similar to what is seen in the uninfected white population\\({}^{+}\\). In keeping with Altfeld et al.\\({}^{+}\\), we suggest that HIV evasion of the cytotoxic NK cell-mediated immune response is far more deleterious for early control of viral replication than are CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells, which are effective only during the adaptive immune response. Considering that ECs do not exhibit many immune mechanisms in non-ECs related to elevated IFNa caused by HIV disruption (Table 1), we propose that a fortuitous low infectious inoculum is an important contributor to EC status. This hypothesis involves several associated predictions now under analysis.\n\nWith a comprehensive characterization of the pathogenic levels of IFNa during both the anti-HIV innate and adaptive immune reactions, we identify elevated IFNa as the key mediator of HIV inhibition of immune cell attack in non-ECs and show how ECs naturally block HIV replication by avoiding elevated IFNa. These findings suggest that reducing IFNa production by any acceptable and efficient means could convert non-ECs to ECs. This proposal is further supported by work carried out in HIV-infected humanized mice showing that anti-IFNa treatment reduces HIV proximal DNA by 14-fold in spleen cells and 7-fold in bone marrow cells\\({}^{+}\\). In an accompanying manuscript, we describe the mechanism of how an inefficient anti-HIV immune response promotes progressive elevation of IFNa\\({}^{16}\\).\n\n## Data availability\n\nSource data for the main figures in the manuscript can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25125377\\({}^{\\text{\\textregistered}}\\).\n\nReceived: 3 May 2023; Accepted: 7 February 2024; Published online: 19 March 2024\n\n## References\n\n* [1] Deeks, S.

The main criteria for establishing a central major mediator of pathogenesis are that it should be active in the earliest days of infection (i.e., in the innate immune phase), be elevated and circulating, and have broad pathogenic effects. The findings show that IFNa meets these criteria. In non-ECs, it circulates at elevated levels, inducing immune cell type abnormalities linked to poor immune cell function (Figs. 1-5 and Table 1). Correspondingly, in ECs, an absence of high\n\nFig. 5: **Distinct immune cell phenotypic patterns between non-B57 and B57 ECs with an individual profile displayed by each patient in these subgroups.**\n\n**a** Comparative analysis of NK cells, CD4\\({}^{+}\\) and CD8\\({}^{+}\\) T-cell subset distribution in non-B57 and B57 ECs.

Based on documented experimental data, we propose that ECs avoid the pathogenic vicious cycle of high HIV \\(\\rightarrow\\) high IFNa \\(\\rightarrow\\) more \\(\\mathrm{HIV}\\rightarrow\\) pathogenic IFNa. We draw this inference based on four key findings, elaborated below.\n\nFirst, at infection onset, NK cells play a critical role in ECs but not in non-ECs. These cells live target cells before the viral setpoint and thus are likely the most effective immune factor reducing viral load and correlated IFNa levels at onset. The differences between NK cells from ECs and non-ECs (Supplementary Fig. 6) lie in their functional capacity. Non-EC NK cells expressing multiple inhibitory receptors, including iKH and checkpoint receptors such as PDI, are likely not functional (Fig. 20B1I, IV and Table 1). Moreover, the low expression of iKIR in NK cells from EC\\({}_{837+}\\) enables these unaltered cells to lyse infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells expressing HLA\\({}_{837-}\\)restricted HIV epitopes, whereas EC\\({}_{837-}\\) NK cells expressing iKIR (Fig. 5B1I), III compensate for this inhibitory signal by expressing the activating NKG2C receptor (Fig. 5BIII), enabling lysis of HLA-E-restricted infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells.\n\nThe second key finding is that IFNa-induced impairment of 7-induced immune cell homeostasis in non-ECs results in the reduction of NK, CCR7\\({}^{+}\\)CD4\\({}^{+}\\), and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)T cells. As a consequence, populations of helper and cytotoxic T cells define during the later adaptive immune response. The third finding is that the hampered IFNa-induced initiation of the adaptive immune response in non-ECs results in diminished CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cell activation and proliferation (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Finally, in non-ECs, inhibition of CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cell function linked to IFNa-induced inhibitory checkpoints results in loss of control of viral replication (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3).\n\nThe consortium of collaborators working on the ECs has postulated a possible immune mechanism enabling control of HIV replication in ECs\\({}^{3}\\) (Fig. 5). In keeping with this concept, we find that in addition to evidence supporting our hypothesis of a putative lower infectious inoculum, each EC exhibited one or more distinct immune mechanisms (Table 1) that could contribute to the avoidance of elevated IFNa levels. These mechanisms include early lysis of infected CD4\\({}^{+}\\)T cells by phenotypically unaltered NK cells and during the adaptive immune response by cytotoxic CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. These data prompted us to consider that EC status does not depend solely on one specific genetic or immune cell profile but also on a distinct immune capacity that is peculiar to each EC case and likely additional circumstantial factors, such as a low inoculum size. There is no doubt that early contributing factors for NK lysis include HLA presentation of HIV peptides by infected cells, including the known HLA\\({}_{837+}\\), and HLA-E, following the adaptive immune response for CTL or CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells. It also is clear that the HLA\\({}_{837}\\) genotype is insufficient to account for EC status, as not all ECs are HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) and HLA\\({}_{837+}\\) is present in up to 11% of patients with progressive disease, similar to what is seen in the uninfected white population\\({}^{+}\\). In keeping with Altfeld et al.\\({}^{+}\\), we suggest that HIV evasion of the cytotoxic NK cell-mediated immune response is far more deleterious for early control of viral replication than are CTL and CD8\\({}^{+}\\)supp cells, which are effective only during the adaptive immune response. Considering that ECs do not exhibit many immune mechanisms in non-ECs related to elevated IFNa caused by HIV disruption (Table 1), we propose that a fortuitous low infectious inoculum is an important contributor to EC status. This hypothesis involves several associated predictions now under analysis.\n\nWith a comprehensive characterization of the pathogenic levels of IFNa during both the anti-HIV innate and adaptive immune reactions, we identify elevated IFNa as the key mediator of HIV inhibition of immune cell attack in non-ECs and show how ECs naturally block HIV replication by avoiding elevated IFNa. These findings suggest that reducing IFNa production by any acceptable and efficient means could convert non-ECs to ECs. This proposal is further supported by work carried out in HIV-infected humanized mice showing that anti-IFNa treatment reduces HIV proximal DNA by 14-fold in spleen cells and 7-fold in bone marrow cells\\({}^{+}\\). In an accompanying manuscript, we describe the mechanism of how an inefficient anti-HIV immune response promotes progressive elevation of IFNa\\({}^{16}\\).\n\n## ", "Data availability": "", "Acknowledgements": "\n\nWe thank the study volunteers and medical personnel.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of MAG-EPA long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplement on prostate cancer proliferation.\n\nMethods A phase Il double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 130 men diagnosed with GG \\(\\geq\\) 2 prostate cancer and undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2015-2017 (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02333435). Participants were randomized to receive 3 g daily of either MAG-EPA (\\(n=65\\)) or placebo (\\(n=65\\)) for 7 weeks (range 4-10) prior to radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was the cancer proliferation index quantified by automated image analysis of tumor nuclear Ki-67 expression using standardized prostatectomy tissue microarrays. Additional planned outcomes at surgery are reported including plasma levels of 27 inflammatory cytokines and fatty acid profiles in circulating red blood cells membranes and prostate tissue.\n\nResults Cancer proliferation index measured by Ki-67 expression was not statistically different between the intervention (3.10%) and placebo (2.85%) groups (\\(p=0.64\\)). In the _per protocol_ analyses, the adjusted estimated effect of MAG-EPA was greater but remained non-significant. Secondary outcome was the changes in plasma levels of 27 cytokines, of which only L-7 was higher in MAG-EPA group compared to placebo (\\(p=0.026\\)). Men randomized to MAG-EPA prior to surgery had four-fold higher EPA levels in prostate tissue compared to those on placebo.\n\nConclusions This MAG-EPA intervention did not affect the primary outcome of prostate cancer proliferation according to nuclear Ki-67 expression. More studies are needed to decipher the effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation in men with prostate cancer.\n\nGlobally every year, 1.4 M men are diagnosed with prostate cancer[1], prompting important life-changing decisions as treatments harbor risks of adverse effects and are costly[2]. Lifestyle factors are thought to impact prostate cancer risk and progression[1]. A diet rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC\\(\\alpha\\)3), mainly found in seafood and fatty fish, could benefit prostate cancer patients, possibly by modulating tissue inflammation[3]. Observational studies have shown mixed results regarding associations between LC\\(\\alpha\\)3 and prostate cancer risk[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 8 \n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe proposed method for the production of a single-produced \\(\\gamma\\)-ray (\\(\\gamma\\)-ray) (\\(\\gamma\\\n\n## Outcomes\n\n### Assessment of Ki-67.\n\nWe built tissue micro-arrays (TMA) of patient's primary, secondary tumor grade regions and benign prostate tissue. One to three paraffin blocks containing tumor and/or normal tissue were selected for each patient. All tumor slides were examined and graded by a pathologist. Spots were selected from hematoxylin and eosin slides to represent the proportion of each Gleason pattern amongst dominant nodules and include a tertiary pattern when present in sufficient quantity. To build the TMA, four representative 1 mm tumor cores (two primary Gleason pattern cores and two secondary Gleason pattern cores) as well as two normal zones close to and away from the tumor (tumor-proximal and tumor-distal, respectively) were taken and placed on a recipient paraffin block along with appropriate alignment and controls using a tissue arrayer (Becher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA).\n\nSections of five micron-thick were cut from the TMA blocks to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a clinical pathology Dako platform. All sections were deparaffinized and heat-induced antigen retrieval with PT Link (PT-11\\(\\mu\\)PT10027, Agilent) in Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution High pH (\\(\\mu\\)K8004, Agilent). Ready-to-use monoclonal mouse antibody clone MIB-1 was used for Ki-67 antigen (\\(\\mu\\)IR626, Agilent) with Autostainer Link48 instrument (\\(\\mu\\)SA480 Agilent) for 20 min. Slides were counterstaineded with Harris hematoxylin. Digital images of IHC-stained TMA slides were obtained at 20X magnification using a slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0 HT; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ, USA).\n\nThe primary outcome for the study was nuclear expression of Ki-67 in tumor cells assessed as a percentage of tumor cells using an automated image analysis approach. We previously showed that this measure was associated with prostate cancer specific survival and highly correlated to an experienced duplicated manual counting[2]. Automated IHC analysis was performed using Calopix 3.2.0 software (TRIBVN healthcare, France). For the purpose of tissue recognition and segmentation, we used a morphometry algorithm by image learning to create a tissue mask and keeping only the tumor and normal epithelial component for analysis. Then, the Calopix -immuno-objects software was applied to each segment. The algorithm used allowed recognition of individual nuclei objects by isolating brown (DAB-stained) and blue (hematoxylin counter-stained) nuclei and reported their numbers. For each tissue core, the total number of objects detected (cell nuclei) and the percent of immunostated objects were computed. We performed five different algorithms to get a global Ki-67 score for each core. We then averaged the Ki-67 score of the patient's TMA cores to get a total, primary, secondary, and benign tissue Ki-67 score for each patient. Ki-67 analysis were performed without knowledge of intervention group.\n\n### Inflammatory mediators\n\nThe plasma levels of 27 cytokines were measured using a 27-plex human cytokine kit (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay from Bio-Rad #X500KCAF0Y0), which measures levels of IL-18, IL-19, IL-2, IL-12, IL-14, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (790), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotax-1, hPG, G-CSF, GM-CSF, l-7, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-14, MIP-19, TNF-A, VEGF, IP-10, PDGF-BB, and RANTES, according to manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine levels were measured at study baseline and at surgery. The Assays were run on Bio-Plex* 200 Systems and data analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager[2] Software 6.1 Build 727. The changes of each cytokine between radical prostatectomy and study baseline was calculated, and the mean of change was reported for both groups.\n\n### Tissue levels of EPA in prostatectomy and RBC membranes\n\nFatty acid profiles in RBC were assessed at baseline and on the day of surgery. Fatty acid profiles were also assessed in snap frozen prostate tissue at surgery. Since a previous study in a similar population showed no difference between benign and malignant tissue fatty acid profiles[2], prostate tissues for these analyses were all collected from the left anterior region of the prostate gland. Fatty acid profiles were determined by gas-chromography mass-spectrometry after total lipid extraction according to a modified Fold method[3] as described previously[4]. Briefly, lysates were isolated by centrifugation and washed with NaCl solution. A solution of chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) was used to extract the lipids from both erythrocyte membranes and tumors with phosphatidylcholine C21:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), as an internal standard. Fatty acid profiles were obtained after methylation in methanol/benzene 4:1 (v/ v) mixed with acetyl chloride[2] and separation by capillary gas chromatography using a temperature gradient on a HP5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a HP-88 capillary column (100 m x 0.25 mm id. x 0.20 mm film thickness Agilent Technologies) coupled to a flame ionization detector. Identification of fatty acids were done according to retention time using standard mixtures: FAK2 37 mix (Supelco Inc, Bellefonte, PA), GLC-411 FA mix (NuChek Prep Inc, Elysian, MN), as well as 22:5n-6 (Laroadan AB, Malmo, Sweden) and 22:5n-3 (Supelco Inc). Fatty acid content is expressed as relative percentages of total fatty acids for RBC and prostate tissue, as well as milligrams of fatty acids per gram of prostate tissue.\n\n### Clinical and pathological outcomes\n\nAs routinely performed, cancer grade and stage were assessed at study baseline (last biopsy leading to enrollment) and on prostatectomy specimens. Cancer grade was evaluated by a pathologist using the ISUP grading system[5][6]. Central pathology review of all biopsy and prostatectomy cases was performed by a dedicated uro-pathologist blinded on intervention group and on biopsy findings.\n\n### Statistical analysis\n\nThe statistical analysis plan was previously published[7]. We used an intention-to-treat approach including all analyzable patients for whom a Ki-67 percentage could be obtained. Average Ki-67 expression from the four tumor cores at prostatectomy, expressed as a percentage of tumor cells, were compared between the intervention and placebo group using two-sided \\(T\\)-tests. Average Ki-67 expression from the two primary tumor cores and the two benign cores were also analyzed. Sensitivity analysis testing the individual Ki-67 analysis algorithms were conducted. Ki-67 measure was log-transformed because its distribution was positively skewed.\n\nMultivariable linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for patients' characteristics that were found to be unbalanced at study baseline (age, BMI, PSA, GG, clinical stage). Covariates were removed if they did not change the effect estimate of the study arm. All final models were adjusted for baseline GG, PSA and clinical T stage. Ki-67 was log-transformed and subtracting one to the exponentiation of the treatment effect corresponds to the Ki-67 relative change (%) in the treatment group compared to placebo. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted using the GLM procedure in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). _Per protocol_ analyses were also performed among patients who adhered to the intervention and placebo by taking at least 80% of their capsules for the first three months for outcomes at prostatectomy.\n\nPreplanned subgroup analyses by baseline \\(L\\)_ca3_ were not carried out because of missing values in the web-FPG for some participants (23%). Subgroup analyses were therefore based on RBC fatty acids (%) at baseline which we showed to be correlated with diet in the previous month[8]. The median was used as a cut point. Analyses were also presented stratified by baseline biopsy grade. Subgroup analyses were performed using the same multivariable linear regression described above with the addition of an interaction term. Bilateral _p_-values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nFor secondary outcome analysis, the change in cytokine levels were compared between groups using \\(T\\)-test, or the non-parametric Flipfer-Policello test when data transformation to achieve normality was not possible. We had planned[7] to use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, but the variance and or the distribution shape was not similar for most cytokines. Thus, for simplicity, the Fligner-Policello test was used. We attempted to normalize the distribution of cytokine level data using simple approaches (e.g. Log(2), Log(10), square-root,...), box-plot[8] and more complex procedures such as the COMBAT procedure using the \"_su_\" and \"_dbromm_\" R package[9][10]. The latter also accounts for batch effect correction. Unfortunately, none of these transformations reached the goal of normalizing the cytokine level data as tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n\nAll data processing steps and statistical analyses were performed in the R v4.1.1 statistical environment (http://www.r-project.org).\n\n### Sample size\n\nSample size analysis was done using a two-sample \\(t\\)-test for a log-normal geometric mean ratio with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming equal variances, for the primary outcome, the percentage of tumor cells expressing Ki-67. In the study conducted by Aronson et al. [23], a statistically significant reduction of 32% in the proportion of cells expressing Ki-67 was observed in a group receiving a low-fat diet supplemented with fish oil compared to a control group assigned to a Western diet. We determined that, for the primary outcome, a total of 126 patients (63/group) will provide 90% power [53, 54] to detect a mean ratio of the proportions of cancer cells expressing Ki-67 of \\(\\approx\\)0.8, i.e. a 20% difference across groups. Based on previous studies [235], a coefficient of variation of 0.4 was assumed. Considering previous low trial dropout rates (\\(<\\)3%), the target sample size was established at 130 participants (65 per group).\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\nParticipants were recruited between February 12, 2015 and June 9, 2017. Trial ended when the target sample size was reached. A total of 397 patients were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Among them, 159 did not meet the inclusion criteria for reasons detailed in Fig. 1.\n\nAfter randomization, only two patients dropped out (1.5%) before surgery in the intervention arm and three participants in each arm were also excluded because the tumor size was too small or an insufficient quantity of tissue was available in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy for tissue microarray (TMA). One last participant of the placebo group was excluded from analysis because of invalid staining issue on TMA. The additional exclusions were not related to the intervention. A total of 61 patients in the placebo group and 60 patients in the intervention group were included in the _intention-to-treat_ analysis for the primary endpoint.\n\nAll randomized patients were included for the reported secondary analysis. All patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in the exploratory analyses.\n\n### Baseline characteristics\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. Compared to the group allocated to placebo, patients in the MAG-EPA intervention group were more likely to have a biopsy GG\\(\\,\\)\\(\\geq\\,\\)4 (25.0% compared to 9.8%). Accordingly, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were, on average, higher in patients allocated to the intervention group (mean = 8.69 ng/mL) compared to patients allocated to placebo (mean = 6.69 ng/mL). Compared to placebo, patients in the intervention arm were older (64.9 vs 62.7 years' old), had a slightly higher BMI (28.75 vs 27.45 kg/m2), and slightly lower EPA level in RBC membranes (0.73 vs 0.80 %). Other characteristics were similarly distributed across groups, including other fatty acid levels in RBC membranes at study baseline (Table 1).\n\nA validated web-based food frequency questionnaire (web-FFQ\\({}^{(\\pm 4)}\\)) was completed by 100/130 (77%) of participants at study baseline. The mean intake of fat, carbohydrates, and proteins expressed as a percentage of total energy intake, was \\(33\\pm 5\\%\\), \\(48\\pm 7\\%\\), and \\(16\\pm 2\\%\\), respectively, for an average daily energy intake of \\(2330\\pm 745\\) kcal. These values are in line with recent healthy dietary recommendations [53, 54]. The mean omega-\\(3\\) dietary fatty acid ratio at baseline was \\(6.3\\pm 1.8\\) which translated into a mean omega-omega3 ratio in the RBC membranes of \\(3.7\\pm 0.64\\).\n\n### Intervention\n\nThe duration of the intervention prior to surgery was not different for both groups with an average duration of \\(52.0\\pm 19.6\\) days for placebo group and \\(53.2\\pm 37.4\\) days for MAG-EPA group (Table 2). Successful implementation of dosing regimen was similar between the two groups with 79% of patients\n\nFigure 1: **CONSORT trial flow diagram.** RCT-EPA study flow chart for the primary endpoint (\\(n=121\\)). For systemic inflammation (secondary endpoint), all randomized men have been included (\\(n=130\\)). For adherence to intervention and adverse events, all men who underwent radical prostatectomy have been included (\\(n=128\\)).

Adherence to intervention (% of taken pills) was similar across groups (87.5% placebo vs 90% MAG-EPA).\n\nCancer proliferation index\n\nintention-to-treat analysis. Average Ki-67 expression in prostate tumor tissue was 3.10% in the intervention arm and 2.85% in the placebo arm (Table 3). The difference was not statistically significant (\\(p\\) = 0.66). Adjustment for GG, PSA and stage yielded a non-significant reduction of Ki-67 in the MAG-EPA arm (relative difference of \\(-5.6\\%\\), 95%CI: \\(-15.8\\) to \\(5.7\\), \\(p\\) = 0.64). Sensitivity analysis during for age and BMI provided similar results. Analyses restricted to primary tumor cores for the Ki-67 assessment also provided similar non-significant results. Analyses stratified by baseline GG and levels of RBC omega-3 fatty acids (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2) showed that the intervention was similarly non-significant across all groups.\n\nPer protocol analysis.Among participants taking at least 80% of study capsules, the average Ki-67 expression in prostate tumor tissue was 3.00% in the intervention arm and 2.90% in the placebo arm (\\(p\\) = 0.94, Table 3).\n\nAdjusted analyses showed a non-significant Ki-67 reduction in the MAG-EPA arm (relative difference of \\(-14.0\\%\\), 95%CI: \\(-34.0\\) to 12.1, \\(p\\) = 0.41). Pre-planned analyses stratified by baseline GG and levels of RBC omega-3 fatty acids (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) showed that the intervention was similarly non-significant across all groups.\n\n### Systemic inflammatory profile\n\nAs planned secondary outcome, inflammatory-related markers were profiled in the plasma of participants at study baseline and at surgery (Table 4). Baseline levels were similar between both groups for all cytokines measured (Supplementary Table 5). From the 27 cytokines measured, only the change of IL-level after 7 weeks of intervention was significantly different between MAG-EPA and placebo groups (Fig. 2, \\(p\\) = 0.026). However, this difference was not significant among participants taking at least 80% of study capsules (_per protocol_ analysis, \\(p\\) = 0.055, Supplementary Table 5).\n\n### Effect of the intervention on RBC and tissue EPA content\n\nAt prostatectomy, the EPA content (% of total fatty acids) in RBC membranes was significantly higher in the intervention group (2.77% in MAG-EPA group versus 0.79% in placebo, \\(p\\) < 0.0001) as well as in the prostate tissue (1.03% in MAG-EPA versus 0.26% in placebo, \\(p\\) < 0.0001) (Table 2, Fig. 3a, b), while the docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content was unchanged (Fig. 3c, \\(p\\) = 0.81).\n\n### Pathological outcomes\n\nClinical outcomes at prostatectomy are presented in Table 5. In contrast to baseline biopsy, prostatectomy grading was more similar between groups.\n\n analyses, but the differences remained not significant. Compared to placebo, the change in IL-7 level was higher in MAG-EPA group. We showed that a daily dose of three grams of MAG-EPA during 7 weeks on average significantly increased fourfold the EPA level in prostate tissue compared to placebo.\n\nThis study showed that MAG-EPA supplement intervention is feasible, tolerated and acceptable to patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer before radical prostatectomy. Most participants who were treated by prostatectomy (\\(n=128\\)) had a successful implementation of dosing regimen (79% taking at least 80% of their capsules in the first 3 months of study) and good adherence to intervention (% of taken pills) despite the absence of follow-up contacts during the intervention. This low-intensity compliance follow-up in our trial is closer to real world practice and contrasts with a previous pre-prostatectomy trial of shorter duration (31 days versus 52 days in our trial) whereby patients \"were contacted weekly by study staff to reinforce compliance\". EPA levels in RBC membranes and prostate tissue, both increased following the intervention, which also support the feasibility of MAG-EPA supplementation. Changing individuals' diet is difficult, hence the popularity of dietary supplements in the general population. To our knowledge, this is the first study measuring the modulation of a specific fatty acid subtype at the absolute level, not only relative level, in the targeted prostate tissue.\n\nThe effect of an omega-3 diet on prostate cancer proliferation was previously studied by Aronson et al. [10] in a phase II randomized controlled trial comparing a low-fat diet enriched with fish oil to a controlled western diet for 4-6 weeks, in \\(55\\) prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy [11]. As a secondary outcome, Ki-67 expression was significantly lower in the low-fat fish oil-supplemented group compared to the western diet group. An important difference between that trial and ours is related to the diet. In the Aronson trial, the control group was under a supervised western diet trying to achieve a 15:1 omega/omega3 fatty acid ratio, suspected to be deleterious for prostate cancer, while the control was a neutral placebo in our trial. The mean omega-6-omega-3 dietary fatty acid ratio at baseline was \\(6.3\\pm 1.8\\) in our cohort compared to 9.6 pre-intervention in their trial [10]. This omega-6-omega-3 ratio in RBC stayed the same for the placebo group overtime (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Characteristics of the intervention**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**Placebo (\\(n=61\\))**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**MAG-EPA (\\(n=60\\))**} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{**\\(p\\)-value**} \\\\ \\hline Duration of intervention before RP (days) (mean \\(\\pm\\) Std) & \\(52.0\\pm 19.6\\) & \\(53.2\\pm 37.4\\) & \\(0.82\\) [FOOTNOTE:]Footnote : **In the case of a single-population participants did not change their diet during the course of our trial. The healthier diet in our study population may have decreased the power to detect a significant effect of MAG-EPA supplementation on tumor Ki-67 expression. The omega-6omega-3 ratio decreased to 2.2 after the MAG-EPA intervention, similar to the fish oil based intervention in the Aronson trial (ratio of 2.7). In the latter study, Ki-67 was expressed in 3.9% of prostate tumor cells for the fish oil intervention group compared to 6.2% in the western diet group. In our study, Ki-67 was expressed in 2.9% and 3.1% of prostate tumor cells in placebo and MAG-EPA groups, respectively. This suggests that increased Ki-67 expression could be more related to unhealthy LCa6 rich diet, rather than to a LCa3 intervention and that omega-6 fatty acids could drive Ki-67 increased expression.\n\nBased on fatty acid profiling in prostate tissue, the absolute level of EPA fatty acid subtype was increased following the concentrated MAG-EPA intervention compared to placebo, but not DHA level. This confirms that the conversion of EPA into DHA in humans is very slow, especially in men tissues, as suggested previously[38]. According to previous results using fish oil-based intervention[32, 39], DHA fatty acid subtype could also be a more important modulator than EPA for the Ki-67 specific marker.\n\nBiological effects of LCa3 are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by their anti-inflammatory properties. We profiled 27 circulating inflammatory mediators, and compared the changes of cytokine levels following 7 weeks of intervention. Only IL-7 was higher in MAG-EPA group compared to placebo, suggesting that MAG-EPA could enhance IL-7-driven immunity. IL-7 is known to play a role in both B and T cells' differentiation, development, and maturation during adaptive immunity. It was also shown to have antitumor activity by enhancing the proliferation and survival of T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment[6]. Indeed recent studies support a potential effect of systemic administration of IL-7 to improve immunotherapy response in prostate cancer[11, 12]. However, we cannot exclude that this only difference was due to multiple comparisons. The significant difference was also weaker in the _per protocol_ analysis, suggesting at best a modest effect of MAG-EPA on circulating IL-7.\n\nHow high EPA prostate tissue level may affect prostate cancer aggressiveness remains unclear. We previously showed that MAG-EPA treatment reduced cancer growth in the TRAMP-C2 syngenetic immune-competent mouse model associated with a significant downregulation of angiogenesis- and vascular-related pathways in the tumor, as well as significant decreased of tumor blood vessel diameter[7]. Prostate tumor blood vessel diameter was also significantly reduced in the first subset of ten MAG-EPA treated, compared to the first 10 placebo treated patients from the present study, but not in the adjacent normal tissue, suggesting that the anti-angiogenic effect is on the tumor-specific microenvironment[7]. Using the same TRAMP-C2 model, we observed a reduced tumor growth in mice fed with an LCa3 enriched diet compared to controls which was associated with an increase in tumor tissue levels of EPA and its derived metabolites, a reduction of pro-angiogenic prostaglandin E2 and increased levels of F4-neuroprostanes and resolvis suspected to have anti-inflammatory effects[8]. More recent data from a subset of patients of the present trial suggest a beneficial effect of MAG-EPA supplement on the gut microbiome[6].\n\nSome limitations are worth mentioning. We did not stratify the randomization for cancer grade. The MAG-EPA group had more cases of higher-grade prostate cancer which increased the Ki-67 expression. Adjusted analyses controlled for this difference but residual confounding remains possible. Our study population had a favorable omega-6omega-3 dietary ratio to start with, as discussed above. It is possible that the MAG-EPA intervention could have reduced the Ki-67 index if performed in a population of prostate cancer patients with higher omega-6 and lower omega-3 intake, which presumably would have had a higher baseline prostate cancer proliferative rate.\n\nIn conclusion, pre-operative MAG-EPA dietary supplementation did not reduce cancer cell Ki-67 index. More studies are needed to better understand the biological and clinical outcomes following this concentrated\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{**Mean difference (std between RP and base-**} \\\\  & **line (pg/mL)** & **mag-EPA (\\(\\mu\\) - 63)** & \\(\\mu\\)**-value** \\\\ \\hline L-1b & -2.27 (0.38) & -0.30 (0.45) & 0.66 \\({}^{\\dagger}\\) \\\\ \\hline L-1fa & -18.60 (06.46) & -13.41 (05.11) & 0.50 \\({}^{\\dagger}\\) \\\\ \\hline L-2 & -1.07 (1.35) & -0.85 (1.35) & 0.32 \\({}^{\\dagger}\\) \\\\ \\hline L-4 & -4.04 (0.59) & -0.26 (0.62) & 0.20 \\({}^{**}\\) \\\\ \\hline L-5 & -1.04 (0.27) & -0.89 EPA supplementation and determine if and how it can benefit prostate cancer patients.\n\n### Data availability\n\nAll source data underlying the graphs and charts are available as Supplementary Data accessible in the Supplementary Information section.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of MAG-EPA long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplement on prostate cancer proliferation.\n\nMethods A phase Il double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 130 men diagnosed with GG \\(\\geq\\) 2 prostate cancer and undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2015-2017 (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02333435). Participants were randomized to receive 3 g daily of either MAG-EPA (\\(n=65\\)) or placebo (\\(n=65\\)) for 7 weeks (range 4-10) prior to radical prostatectomy. The primary outcome was the cancer proliferation index quantified by automated image analysis of tumor nuclear Ki-67 expression using standardized prostatectomy tissue microarrays. Additional planned outcomes at surgery are reported including plasma levels of 27 inflammatory cytokines and fatty acid profiles in circulating red blood cells membranes and prostate tissue.\n\nResults Cancer proliferation index measured by Ki-67 expression was not statistically different between the intervention (3.10%) and placebo (2.85%) groups (\\(p=0.64\\)). In the _per protocol_ analyses, the adjusted estimated effect of MAG-EPA was greater but remained non-significant. Secondary outcome was the changes in plasma levels of 27 cytokines, of which only L-7 was higher in MAG-EPA group compared to placebo (\\(p=0.026\\)). Men randomized to MAG-EPA prior to surgery had four-fold higher EPA levels in prostate tissue compared to those on placebo.\n\nConclusions This MAG-EPA intervention did not affect the primary outcome of prostate cancer proliferation according to nuclear Ki-67 expression. More studies are needed to decipher the effects of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplementation in men with prostate cancer.\n\nGlobally every year, 1.4 M men are diagnosed with prostate cancer[1], prompting important life-changing decisions as treatments harbor risks of adverse effects and are costly[2]. Lifestyle factors are thought to impact prostate cancer risk and progression[1]. A diet rich in long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC\\(\\alpha\\)3), mainly found in seafood and fatty fish, could benefit prostate cancer patients, possibly by modulating tissue inflammation[3]. Observational studies have shown mixed results regarding associations between LC\\(\\alpha\\)3 and prostate cancer risk[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 8 \n\n###### Abstract\n\nThe proposed method for the production of a single-produced \\(\\gamma\\)-ray (\\(\\gamma\\)-ray) (\\(\\gamma\\\n\n## ", "Outcomes": "\n\n### ", "Assessment of Ki-67.": "\n\nWe built tissue micro-arrays (TMA) of patient's primary, secondary tumor grade regions and benign prostate tissue. One to three paraffin blocks containing tumor and/or normal tissue were selected for each patient. All tumor slides were examined and graded by a pathologist. Spots were selected from hematoxylin and eosin slides to represent the proportion of each Gleason pattern amongst dominant nodules and include a tertiary pattern when present in sufficient quantity. To build the TMA, four representative 1 mm tumor cores (two primary Gleason pattern cores and two secondary Gleason pattern cores) as well as two normal zones close to and away from the tumor (tumor-proximal and tumor-distal, respectively) were taken and placed on a recipient paraffin block along with appropriate alignment and controls using a tissue arrayer (Becher Instruments, Sun Prairie, WI, USA).\n\nSections of five micron-thick were cut from the TMA blocks to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a clinical pathology Dako platform. All sections were deparaffinized and heat-induced antigen retrieval with PT Link (PT-11\\(\\mu\\)PT10027, Agilent) in Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution High pH (\\(\\mu\\)K8004, Agilent). Ready-to-use monoclonal mouse antibody clone MIB-1 was used for Ki-67 antigen (\\(\\mu\\)IR626, Agilent) with Autostainer Link48 instrument (\\(\\mu\\)SA480 Agilent) for 20 min. Slides were counterstaineded with Harris hematoxylin. Digital images of IHC-stained TMA slides were obtained at 20X magnification using a slide scanner (NanoZoomer 2.0 HT; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ, USA).\n\nThe primary outcome for the study was nuclear expression of Ki-67 in tumor cells assessed as a percentage of tumor cells using an automated image analysis approach. We previously showed that this measure was associated with prostate cancer specific survival and highly correlated to an experienced duplicated manual counting[2]. Automated IHC analysis was performed using Calopix 3.2.0 software (TRIBVN healthcare, France). For the purpose of tissue recognition and segmentation, we used a morphometry algorithm by image learning to create a tissue mask and keeping only the tumor and normal epithelial component for analysis. Then, the Calopix -immuno-objects software was applied to each segment. The algorithm used allowed recognition of individual nuclei objects by isolating brown (DAB-stained) and blue (hematoxylin counter-stained) nuclei and reported their numbers. For each tissue core, the total number of objects detected (cell nuclei) and the percent of immunostated objects were computed. We performed five different algorithms to get a global Ki-67 score for each core. We then averaged the Ki-67 score of the patient's TMA cores to get a total, primary, secondary, and benign tissue Ki-67 score for each patient. Ki-67 analysis were performed without knowledge of intervention group.\n\n### ", "Inflammatory mediators": "\n\nThe plasma levels of 27 cytokines were measured using a 27-plex human cytokine kit (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine 27-plex Assay from Bio-Rad #X500KCAF0Y0), which measures levels of IL-18, IL-19, IL-2, IL-12, IL-14, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12 (790), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotax-1, hPG, G-CSF, GM-CSF, l-7, MCP-1 (MCAF), MIP-14, MIP-19, TNF-A, VEGF, IP-10, PDGF-BB, and RANTES, according to manufacturer's instructions. Cytokine levels were measured at study baseline and at surgery. The Assays were run on Bio-Plex* 200 Systems and data analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager[2] Software 6.1 Build 727. The changes of each cytokine between radical prostatectomy and study baseline was calculated, and the mean of change was reported for both groups.\n\n### ", "Tissue levels of EPA in prostatectomy and RBC membranes": "\n\nFatty acid profiles in RBC were assessed at baseline and on the day of surgery. Fatty acid profiles were also assessed in snap frozen prostate tissue at surgery. Since a previous study in a similar population showed no difference between benign and malignant tissue fatty acid profiles[2], prostate tissues for these analyses were all collected from the left anterior region of the prostate gland. Fatty acid profiles were determined by gas-chromography mass-spectrometry after total lipid extraction according to a modified Fold method[3] as described previously[4]. Briefly, lysates were isolated by centrifugation and washed with NaCl solution. A solution of chloroform/methanol 2:1 (v/v) was used to extract the lipids from both erythrocyte membranes and tumors with phosphatidylcholine C21:0 (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), as an internal standard. Fatty acid profiles were obtained after methylation in methanol/benzene 4:1 (v/ v) mixed with acetyl chloride[2] and separation by capillary gas chromatography using a temperature gradient on a HP5890 gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Toronto, Canada) equipped with a HP-88 capillary column (100 m x 0.25 mm id. x 0.20 mm film thickness Agilent Technologies) coupled to a flame ionization detector. Identification of fatty acids were done according to retention time using standard mixtures: FAK2 37 mix (Supelco Inc, Bellefonte, PA), GLC-411 FA mix (NuChek Prep Inc, Elysian, MN), as well as 22:5n-6 (Laroadan AB, Malmo, Sweden) and 22:5n-3 (Supelco Inc).

Cancer grade was evaluated by a pathologist using the ISUP grading system[5][6]. Central pathology review of all biopsy and prostatectomy cases was performed by a dedicated uro-pathologist blinded on intervention group and on biopsy findings.\n\n### ", "Statistical analysis": "\n\nThe statistical analysis plan was previously published[7]. We used an intention-to-treat approach including all analyzable patients for whom a Ki-67 percentage could be obtained. Average Ki-67 expression from the four tumor cores at prostatectomy, expressed as a percentage of tumor cells, were compared between the intervention and placebo group using two-sided \\(T\\)-tests. Average Ki-67 expression from the two primary tumor cores and the two benign cores were also analyzed. Sensitivity analysis testing the individual Ki-67 analysis algorithms were conducted. Ki-67 measure was log-transformed because its distribution was positively skewed.\n\nMultivariable linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for patients' characteristics that were found to be unbalanced at study baseline (age, BMI, PSA, GG, clinical stage). Covariates were removed if they did not change the effect estimate of the study arm. All final models were adjusted for baseline GG, PSA and clinical T stage. Ki-67 was log-transformed and subtracting one to the exponentiation of the treatment effect corresponds to the Ki-67 relative change (%) in the treatment group compared to placebo. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted using the GLM procedure in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). _Per protocol_ analyses were also performed among patients who adhered to the intervention and placebo by taking at least 80% of their capsules for the first three months for outcomes at prostatectomy.\n\nPreplanned subgroup analyses by baseline \\(L\\)_ca3_ were not carried out because of missing values in the web-FPG for some participants (23%). Subgroup analyses were therefore based on RBC fatty acids (%) at baseline which we showed to be correlated with diet in the previous month[8]. The median was used as a cut point. Analyses were also presented stratified by baseline biopsy grade. Subgroup analyses were performed using the same multivariable linear regression described above with the addition of an interaction term. Bilateral _p_-values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nFor secondary outcome analysis, the change in cytokine levels were compared between groups using \\(T\\)-test, or the non-parametric Flipfer-Policello test when data transformation to achieve normality was not possible. We had planned[7] to use the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, but the variance and or the distribution shape was not similar for most cytokines. Thus, for simplicity, the Fligner-Policello test was used. We attempted to normalize the distribution of cytokine level data using simple approaches (e.g. Log(2), Log(10), square-root,...), box-plot[8] and more complex procedures such as the COMBAT procedure using the \"_su_\" and \"_dbromm_\" R package[9][10]. The latter also accounts for batch effect correction. Unfortunately, none of these transformations reached the goal of normalizing the cytokine level data as tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\n\nAll data processing steps and statistical analyses were performed in the R v4.1.1 statistical environment (http://www.r-project.org).\n\n### ", "Sample size": "\n\nSample size analysis was done using a two-sample \\(t\\)-test for a log-normal geometric mean ratio with a two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming equal variances, for the primary outcome, the percentage of tumor cells expressing Ki-67.

Trial ended when the target sample size was reached. A total of 397 patients were assessed for eligibility (Fig. 1). Among them, 159 did not meet the inclusion criteria for reasons detailed in Fig. 1.\n\nAfter randomization, only two patients dropped out (1.5%) before surgery in the intervention arm and three participants in each arm were also excluded because the tumor size was too small or an insufficient quantity of tissue was available in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostatectomy for tissue microarray (TMA). One last participant of the placebo group was excluded from analysis because of invalid staining issue on TMA. The additional exclusions were not related to the intervention. A total of 61 patients in the placebo group and 60 patients in the intervention group were included in the _intention-to-treat_ analysis for the primary endpoint.\n\nAll randomized patients were included for the reported secondary analysis. All patients who underwent radical prostatectomy were included in the exploratory analyses.\n\n### ", "Baseline characteristics": "\n\nBaseline characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1. Compared to the group allocated to placebo, patients in the MAG-EPA intervention group were more likely to have a biopsy GG\\(\\,\\)\\(\\geq\\,\\)4 (25.0% compared to 9.8%). Accordingly, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were, on average, higher in patients allocated to the intervention group (mean = 8.69 ng/mL) compared to patients allocated to placebo (mean = 6.69 ng/mL). Compared to placebo, patients in the intervention arm were older (64.9 vs 62.7 years' old), had a slightly higher BMI (28.75 vs 27.45 kg/m2), and slightly lower EPA level in RBC membranes (0.73 vs 0.80 %). Other characteristics were similarly distributed across groups, including other fatty acid levels in RBC membranes at study baseline (Table 1).\n\nA validated web-based food frequency questionnaire (web-FFQ\\({}^{(\\pm 4)}\\)) was completed by 100/130 (77%) of participants at study baseline.

However, with other factors, such as affordability critical for care access, it is important to explore accessibility across groups. We assessed CEmOC geographical accessibility by wealth status in the 15 most-populated Nigerian cities.\n\n**Methods** We mapped city boundaries, verified and geecocoded functional CEmOC facilities, and assembled population distribution for women of childbearing age and Meta's Relative Wealth Index (RWI). We used the Google Maps Platform's internal Directions Application Programming Interface to obtain driving times to public and private facilities. City-level median travel time (MTT) and number of CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min were summarised for peak and non-peak hours per wealth quintile. The correlation between RWI and MTT to the nearest public CEmOC was calculated.\n\n**Results** We show that MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility is lowest in the wealthiest 20% in all cities, with the largest difference in MTT between the wealthiest 20% and least wealthy 20% seen in Onitsha (26 vs 81 min) and the smallest in Wari (20 vs 30 min). Similarly, the average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min varies (11 among the wealthiest 20% and six among the least wealthy in Kano). In five cities, zero facilities are reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Those who live in the suburbs particularly have poor accessibility to CEmOC facilities.\n\n**Conclusions** Our findings show that the least wealthy mostly have poor accessibility to care. Interventions addressing CEmOC geographical accessibility targeting poor people are needed to address inequities in urban settings.\n\nWomen with complications of pregnancy and childbirth, including haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, sepsis, and abortion, require timely access to emergency obstetric care (EmOC), as any delay increases odds of poor pregnancy outcomes, including morbidity and mortality[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, huge challenges in accessing EmOC services. These challenges occur at a micro- (relating to the woman and her circumstances), meso- (relating to the health facility she is trying to access while in an emergency), and macro-level (relating to the way the health system is organised)'.\n\nIn 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that comprehensive EmOC (CEmOC), which is the full set of nine clinical and surgical evidence-based interventions, including caesarean section and blood transfusion, should be available in hospitals no further than 2-3 h travel time for most women [7]. However, there are ongoing debates about the adequacy of this travel time benchmark, as emerging evidence in urban African settings shows that women with pregnancy complications who are referred and require 30 min of travel to reach an appropriate level of care have significantly poorer outcomes than those who travelless than 10 min to care [8]. For their babies, direct travel to care of 10 min or more significantly increases their chance of being born dead [9].\n\nThere has been a wide perception that pregnant women in rural areas are particularly disadvantaged regarding access to care compared to those in urban areas [10]. Compared to rural areas, urban areas seemingly provide better geographical accessibility to infrastructure, services, and opportunities, including those for healthcare. However, this so-called urban advantage, which urban dwellers are deemed to have over rural ones in terms of infrastructure and outcomes, appears to be diminishing as urban planning is not catching up with population growth. The United Nations (UN) projects that by 2050, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas, and 40% of the projected additional 2.5 billion people living in urban areas worldwide will be in Africa [1]. Also, in many urban areas in Africa, though travel distances to the nearest health facilities are generally shorter, in reality, travel times to these facilities are often much longer than perceived because of poor roads, traffic congestion, haphazard urban planning, and growing informal settlements [11, 12, 13]. These issues pose particular challenges for pregnant women trying to access EmOC, especially with the current rapid rate of urbanisation, which means cities are saturating and populations are spreading into the surrounding peri-urban areas. However, the urban poor face even greater challenges, with the global community recognising at the 2016 United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in Quito that they are \"_excluded from access to services_\" [4, 5].\n\nPrevious research shows that poverty and long travel time to care are important determinants of health facility delivery by pregnant women in Africa, though, their influence on whether women give birth in a health facility varies within and across countries [17]. Before utilisation, a woman must be able to access the facility [17]. However, he ability to access care can also be influenced by her socioeconomic status [18]. For pregnant women in an emergency, geographical accessibility to EmOC potentially has life-or-death consequences. In terms of their pathway to care, this is also varied. Some travel directly to facilities that can provide the care they need, while others must be referred to reach such facilities [19, 20]. Robust research to show relationships between travel time to care needs to be able to reflect closer-to-reality pathways to care and be linkable to spatially represented wealth index data of the population, which is commonly used as a proxy for socio-economic status in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings [21]. For such research done in urban areas, they also need to capture the realites of travel in such settings. However, almost all modelled EmOC geographical accessibility studies do not incorporate urban challenges such as traffic, which leads to an underestimation of travel time [14, 20, 21]. To date, the lack of sufficiently high spatial resolution data for closer-to-reality travel time and population wealth index has precluded robust analysis comparing the extent of EmOC accessibility between the poor and the rich African urban areas. In this study, in which we address this knowledge gap by assessing CEmOC geographic accessibility by population wealth index in 15 of the most-populated Nigerian cities, we find that travel time to the nearest public \\(\\cemOC\\) facility is highest and number of functional public \\(\\cemOC\\) facilities is lowest for the least wealthy 20% in cities. We hope that the results will help identify if and where to intervene in action to improve EmOC geographical accessibility.\n\n## Methods\n\n### Study setting\n\nNigeria is administratively divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory. The states are divided into 774 local government areas (LGAs). Each state has one or two major cities, with at least 20 of the major cities across the country having a population of over half a million [9]. There has been increasing urbanisation in Nigeria, with some of its reported consequences being the movement of city populations to peripheral suburbs, expansion of informal settlements, increasing traffic, and an urban health crisis [9]. For many women living in urban areas of Nigeria, the majority will travel to EmOC facilities when in situations of emergency using motorised transport [22, 23]. We conducted this study in 15 Nigerian cities, all with a projected population of at least one million in 2022 (current) or 2030 (end term of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)) [24]: Aba, Abuja, Benin City, Ibadan, Ilorin, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Maiduguri, Ontisha, Owerri, Port Harcourt, Uyo, and Warri. Overall, the 15 cities accounted for 26% of the national population in 2022 [Supplementary Table 1].\n\n### Study design\n\nThis cross-sectional study involved the assembly of data to define extended city boundaries to include peripheral suburbs, verify CEmOC facility functionality and geographic location (latitude and longitude), and map population distribution for women of childbearing age (WoCBA) aged 15-49 years to estimate the travel time to care. Details of the methods used to collect and collate data for the study as well as estimate travel time, are described below and have been published in our Data Descriptor paper [9].\n\n### Data assembly\n\n#### Administrative boundaries\n\nAs the precise boundaries of the selected cities were not available for spatial analysis, we established the extended boundaries of each city (including suburbs) by the LGAs that make it up. For this, we spatially superimposed the vector file of the LGAs boundaries [9], WorldPop's gridded surface of the population (at 100 m\\({}^{2}\\) resolution) [9], Google Maps (Alphabet, Mountain View, California), and Global Human Settlement (GHS) layers showing the gridded surfaces of urban areas [9]. For each city, we selected all LGAs with areas of higher population density than their surroundings or marked as urban or suburban/peri-urban in the GHS layer [9]. Discussions amongst co-authors familiar with the cities helped improve the delineation process. Within the administrative boundaries, we considered the entire area comprising level 14 S2 cells, as defined by Google. The S2 cell optimises the splitting of spherical surfaces into grids of approximately equal size. Specifically, level 14 S2 cells are approximately 600 by 600 metres [1]. This resolution was selected to balance accuracy and computational power.\n\n#### Hospitals\n\nA list of hospitals in the 15 cities was first extracted from the 2018 Nigeria Health Facility Registry (NHFR) [9]. Information on the facility name, ownership, location (LGA and GPS coordinates), and operational status (open or closed) were retained from the NHFR. The NHFR data was supplemented by state-specific lists such as that of the Health Facilities Monitoring and Accreditation Agency in Lagos State [9] and by data gathered from stakeholders familiar with health service provision in the other states. We removed duplicates after combining the lists and assigning unique codes to each hospital. Data on service availability was obtained through a facility functionality assessment survey conducted with health facility administrators to specifically establish facilities that were operational 24 h a day and able to conduct caesarean sections (used as a proxy for CEmOC in this study, as capacity for other EmOC services provision is usually subsumed in capacity for caesarean sections). We also confirmed facility ownership (public--federal or state, or private--for-profit, not-for-profit, faith-based organisations, military, or police-owned facilities). The survey was conducted during in-person hospital visitations by trained research assistants using a short questionnaire. Data collection took place from March to August 2022. Our curated list of verified CEmOC facilities is publicly available [18, 22].\n\n \n\n**Population distribution.** We obtained the constrained version of population distribution of WoGBA at 1 km\\({}^{2}\\) spatial resolutions from WorldPop's open spatial demographic data portal\\({}^{\\#}\\). WorldPop uses dasymetric techniques to create the gridded surface by disaggregating 2006 census data from LGAs based on weights derived from covariates such as land use, land cover, and night-time lights\\({}^{\\#}\\). National estimates were projected to match United Nations Population Division 2022 estimates while adjusting for differences between rural and urban areas. Age and sex multipliers data from census and household data were then applied to the projected national estimates to derive the proportion of WoCBA nationally. Geospatial layers of various resolutions were resampled to 600 by 600 metres to match the spatial granularity of the 14 S2 cells\\({}^{\\#}\\).\n\n**Relative wealth.** We utilised Meta's Relative Wealth Index (RWI) as a measure of wealth at the level of S2 cell\\({}^{\\#}\\). This index estimates the relative wealth of the people living in each macro-region relative to others in the same country. The index is based on de-identified connectivity data, geospatial \"big\" data from satellites and other existing sensors, used to train a machine-learning algorithm that predicts microregional poverty. Data for Nigeria was based on a survey of 40,680 households in 899 unique survey locations (known as 'villages'). The survey included questions that assessed socio-economic circumstances of each household. RWI values are available for small areas (also referred to as micro-regions), each of approximately 2.4 km\\({}^{2}\\) in size\\({}^{\\#}\\). RWI for each S2 cell was taken from that of its nearest micro-region.\n\n**Computing travel time and geographical coverage**\n\nWe extracted travel times for each 14 S2 grid cell from the Google Maps Platform's internal Directions Application Programming Interface (API), which uses Machine-Learning models that leverage a range of inputs to estimate travel time\\({}^{\\#}\\). The travel times were based on motorised transport from each grid centre as the origin to the nearest CEmOC facilities by ownership (public and privited). Motorised transport was used as available evidence from the country showed that it was the most common means of transport to care for pregnant women in emergency\\({}^{\\#}\\)[27, 4]. For each ownership type, we derived travel times during the peak traffic scenario for weekdays 18-20 h for the off-peak traffic scenario for weekends 01-03 h. The curated dataset of closer-to-reality travel time estimates for all selected cities is publicly available\\({}^{\\#}\\)[34].\n\nTo provide summary statistics on the geographic accessibility of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5. We reported the median travel time (MTT) to the nearest CEmOC facility (1. public only, and 2. public or private), as well as the average number of reachable CEmOC facilities (1. public only, and 2. public or private), during weekday 6-8 pm by quintiles. We also compared the MITT and average number of reachable facilities between peak and off-peak travel scenarios by quintiles and by city.\n\nPearson correlation between RWI and travel time to the nearest public CEmOC was calculated for each city. We further grouped the S2 cells by RWI (Q1-Q2, vs Q3-Q5) and compared the percentage of S2 cells with travel time to the nearest public CEmOC longer than 60 min. We produced maps to illustrate the spatial distribution of wealth and shorter/longer travel time. Travel times for S2 cells exceeding 50 km away from their nearest target facility and those with no accessible road path to any facility were not computed; these were replaced with the maximum travel time specific to the city, traffic scenarios (peak or off-peak), and facility type (public, private, or private and private) for the purpose of correlation calculation.\n\nWe conducted analysis and visualisation as static maps with R version 4.2.0 (R Development Core Team, Auckland, New Zealand) and ArcMap (ESRI ArcGIS, Redlands, California, US). The data used are publicly available and described in detail elsewhere\\({}^{\\#}\\).\n\n**Ethics statement**\n\nEthics approval for the study was obtained from the National Health Research and Ethics Committee in Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007-11/04/2022) and the University of Greenwich Research and Ethics Committee (UREC/214.7.8).

Travel times for S2 cells exceeding 50 km away from their nearest target facility and those with no accessible road path to any facility were not computed; these were replaced with the maximum travel time specific to the city, traffic scenarios (peak or off-peak), and facility type (public, private, or private and private) for the purpose of correlation calculation.\n\nWe conducted analysis and visualisation as static maps with R version 4.2.0 (R Development Core Team, Auckland, New Zealand) and ArcMap (ESRI ArcGIS, Redlands, California, US). The data used are publicly available and described in detail elsewhere\\({}^{\\#}\\).\n\n**Ethics statement**\n\nEthics approval for the study was obtained from the National Health Research and Ethics Committee in Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007-11/04/2022) and the University of Greenwich Research and Ethics Committee (UREC/214.7.8). Informed consent was obtained from health facility administrators for the facility functionality assessment survey. However, Informed consent was not required for publicly available datasets on population distribution and RWI, which were secondarily used in this study.\n\n**Reporting summary**\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcross the 15 cities, 132,474 S2 cells were included [Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1-15]. We verified the existence, functionality, and location of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5. We reported the median travel time (MTT) to the nearest CEmOC facility (1. public only, and 2. public or private), as well as the average number of reachable CEmOC facilities (1. public only, and 2. public or private), during weekday 6-8 pm by quintiles. We also compared the MITT and average number of reachable facilities between peak and off-peak travel scenarios by quintiles and by city.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcross the 15 cities, 132,474 S2 cells were included [Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1-15].

We verified the existence, functionality, and location of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5. We reported the median travel time (MTT) to the nearest CEmOC facility (1. public only, and 2. public or private), as well as the average number of reachable CEmOC facilities (1. public only, and 2. public or private), during weekday 6-8 pm by quintiles. We also compared the MITT and average number of reachable facilities between peak and off-peak travel scenarios by quintiles and by city.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcEstimated population by 2030 ranges from 1.1 million in Maiduguri to 20.6 million in Lagos. The estimated population of WoCBA for 2022 was 11.5 million (6% of the country's overall population) [Table 1].\n\nIn 13 of 15 cities, MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility was lowest in the wealthiest 20% of cells. In Benin City, for instance, MTT in Q5 was 43 min versus over 60 min in Q1 and Q2. The largest difference between Q1 and Q5 was observed in Ontika (26 vs. 81 min), whilst the smallest difference was observed in Ontika (20 vs. 30 min). When incorporating private CEmOC facilities (i.e., MTT to nearest public or private facility), MTT for all quintiles in all cities reduced, though the magnitudes of the reductions varied. For example, reductions were relatively mild in all groups in Maiduguri and Abuja. Nonetheless, MTT in all groups and all cities dropped below 60 min, and in seven cities, including Abu, Uyo, Kano, Ilorin, Jos, Maiduguri, and Warri in all groups dropped below 30 min [Fig. 1].\n\nThe average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min was as high as 12 among the wealthiest 20% of cells in Kano, where reachable facilities totaled seven in Q1. In Lagos, Kaduna, Ontika, Port Harcourt, and Benin City, zero facilities were reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Lagos had the widest inequality gap for reachable public CEmOC facilities (nine in Q5 vs zero in Q1), followed by Ibadan and Kano. The top-inequality pattern (the wealthiest subgroup experiencing considerably better accessibility than other groups) appeared in Abuja, Jos, and Port Harcourt. With additional consideration of private CEmOC facilities, the number of reachable facilities exceeded 30 for all groups, including Q1, in Ibadan, Ilorin, Uyo, Kano, Owerri, and Aba. Lagos remained with the widest inequality gap, where 4 and 293 facilities were within reach under 30 min for the lowest and highest wealth quintiles, respectively [Fig. 1].\n\nAs a general pattern, MTT and the number of reachable facilities during peak and off-peak traffic were similar in most cities and wealth groups. However, some exceptions were noted. In Lagos, for instance, the number of reachable facilities within 60 min was nine during peak traffic and 16 during off-peak traffic in the wealthiest 20%. In Abuja, the number of reachable facilities during peak and off-peak traffic was eight and 11, respectively [Fig. 2].\n\nAll cities had negative correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI. The correlation coefficient was the largest in magnitude in Ontika (\\(r=-0.70,95\\%\\) CI [\\(-0.73\\),\\(-0.68\\)]) and smallest in Aba (\\(r=-0.26,95\\%\\) CI [\\(-0.30\\),\\(-0.22\\)]) [Fig. 3], where the percentages of the least wealth 40% of 52 cells that had MTT above 60 min were 86.1% and 0.3%, respectively [Table 2]. In Ontika, the locations of such cells spanned the southern part, whilst the MTT was within 60 min in the North, where RWI was generally higher [Fig. 4]. Alongside Ontisha, three other cities had over 60% poorer S2 cells, mostly in the city outskirts, with longer MTT of 60\\(+\\) minutes (Port Harcourt, Kaduna, and Benin City). In Warri,\n\nFig. 1: **Equiplot of geographic accessibility by relative wealth in 15 cities in Nigeria.****a** Median Travl Time (MTT) to the nearest public comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) facility in minutes in 15 cities in Nigeria by quintile of relative wealth. **b** MTT to the nearest public or private CEmOC facility in minutes.\n\n Maiduguri, Uyo, Ilorin, Kano, Owerri, and Aba, over 80% of the least wealthy 40% of cells had MTT \\(\\leq\\) 60 min [Fig. 3].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study assessed CEmOC geographical accessibility by population wealth index in 15 cities in Nigeria using closer-to-reality travel time estimates during peak and off-peak traffic times and to public and public or private facilities. Our study found that in 13 of 15 cities, MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility was lowest in areas habited by the wealthiest 20% of the population. Similarly, the number of functional public CEmOC facilities that could be reached was typically the lowest amongst the poorest 20% of the urban population across cities, with the least wealthy 20% in some cities unable to reach one public facility within 60 min. The number of accessible facilities varied in some cities depending on travel periods (peak v. non-peak), and correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI were negative in all cities. Broadly, it appeared those who lived in the core center of the city had better accessibility to functional public CEmOC facilities, with a higher proportion of those with better accessibility being the wealthiest 60%.\n\nOur study revealed strong within-city inequities for CEmOC accessibility aligned with the RWI of places where urban dwellers are domiciled. The least wealthy 20% travel furthest to functional public CEmOC. We observed the largest difference in MTT between the wealthiest 20% and poorest 20% in Ohnisha (26 vs 81 min) and the smallest difference in Warri (20 vs 30 min). Similarly, the average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min varied across cities. It was as high as 11 among the wealthiest 20% in Kano, while reachable facilities totalled six amongst the least wealthy. In some cities, including Lagos, Kaduna, Ontisha, Port Harcourt, and Benin City, zero facilities were reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Reviewing the spatial distribution of where the least wealthy population live compared with the areas that have poor accessibility to functional public CEmOC facilities, it becomes clear that those who live in the suburbs are particularly vulnerable. This aligns with findings from a previous assessment of geographical accessibility, which recreated journeys of pregnant women who presented in an emergency in Lagos[1]. In our study, correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI were negative in all cities, suggesting lower MTT from wealthier places.\n\nSome additional insights that can be gleaned from our study include that geographical accessibility, looking at peak and off-peak travel times, were similar for most cities. However, larger cities, such as Abuja, Kano, and Lagos, generally had worse accessibility in terms of the number of functional public CEmOC facilities that could be reached during peak traffic times. In a separate study, we showed that many slum areas, where many of the least wealthy populations are domiciled, have the worst accessibility to public sector care[1]. A previous study in Bangladesh found that variability in traffic congestion significantly affected travel time to care and availability of healthcare services for slum populations, with only 63% of the city's slum population able to reach emergency services within 60 min[1].\n\nThe inequities observed somewhat relate to the distribution of the facilities, with more functional ones situated more in the core of the cities than in the peripheral suburbs. For example, in Kano, where almost the entire city population could reach functional public CEmOC facilities within 60 min, there was a relatively even distribution of facilities across space. Although adding the private facilities reduced travel time and massively increased the number of available facilities within 60 min of travel for many cities, there remains a cost barrier in accessing care in such facilities for the least wealthy that needs to be considered[1, 2, 3]. In addition, concerns have been raised about the quality of EmOC available within the private sector[1]. Irrespective of the potential opportunity that private facilities bring to the health system, governments must continue strategically exploring opportunities to situate CEmOC facilities in areas of geographical access inequities. By leveraging evidence such as the one we have provided in this study, which can also be presented in a digital dashboard, policymakers will be able to identify optimal location for such facilities that guarantee the best\n\nFig. 2: **Geographic accessibility to the nearest public CEmOC facility in 15 cities in Nigeria by wealth quintile of S2 cells\u2014peak vs. off-peak. a Median travel time (MTT) to the nearest public comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) facility during peak hours (weekday 18\u201320 h) and off-peak hours (weekend 01-03 h) shown as a scatter plot, with each circle corresponding to a wealth quintile in one of 15 cities in Nigeria. b Number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min** value for money, despite the cost of service provision, can be established [50, 51, 52, 53]. A public CEmOC facility in Lagos led to a 42-minute reduction in mean travel time in Lagos [6].\n\nThere are several strengths of our approach worth highlighting. First, our study was based on algorithmic outputs generated using Google Maps Platform's internal Directions API, the external version of which has been shown to offer closer-to-reality time estimates [14]. Only a handful of published studies have investigated the link between wealth and healthcare utilisation in LMIC settings, and even fewer have focused on explaining the socio-demographic inequality between wealth and healthcare accessibility [13, 17, 25, 43], with the few that looked at it, using mostly modelled travel time estimates which were less reflective of real-world travel, especially in the urban space [14]. Our analysis sheds light on the realistic geographic accessibility barriers that hindered the less wealthy more markedly; we hope this adds new insights to the evidence base of health inequality and health service planning and policy [53]. This approach can be scaled up to ensure the use of closer-to-reality travel time estimates is combined with other datasets to inform policy in urban Africa [1]. In addition, we have included only facilities verified as having the capacity to provide caesarean section, with previous analyses including all facilities and not specifically confirming service capacity. Furthermore, our approach reflected traffic variability, highlighting accessibility during peak and off-peak travel times, which is critical for a holistic understanding of accessibility in urban areas. Finally, we have used a finer spatial scale at 0.6 by 0.6 km for our analysis of travel time--an approach deemed by expert to ensure greater accuracy and robustness in model inputs for informing policy and decision-making [9].\n\nHowever, our results should be interpreted with certain limitations in mind. First, RWI was modelled on many predictors but did not include traffic. This permits our investigation into the relationship between RWI and TT. However, among the model predictors for RWI were population density, road density, and 'built-up' -ness [9]. All these play into traffic and travel time to some extent, which might mean some correlations in the\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Least wealthy 40\\% of**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**Wealthiest 60\\% of S2 cells**} \\\\  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**52 cells**} & & \\\\ \\cline{2-5}  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**MTT \\textgreater{}60 min**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**MTT \\textless{}60 min**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**MTT \\textless{}60 min**} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{**MTT \\textless{}60 min**} \\\\ \\hline Aba & 0.3 & 99.7 & 0.2 & 99.8 \\\\ \\hline Abaja & 27.5 & 72.5 & 7.5 & 92.5 \\\\ \\hline Berin City & 53.0 & 47.0 & 22.4 & 77.6 \\\\ \\hline Ibadan & 33.8 & 66.2 & 5.5 & 94.5 \\\\ \\hline Iorini & 6.9 & 93.1 & 0.3 & 99.7 \\\\ \\hline Jos & 46.3 & 53.7 & 16.0 & 84.0 \\\\ \\hline Kaduna & 57.9 & 42.1 & 30.8 & 69.2 \\\\ \\hline Karoo & 5.3 & 94.7 & 3.3 & 96.7 \\\\ \\hline Lagos & 29.0 & 71.0 & 5.4 & 94.6 \\\\ \\hline Miduloguri & 13.3 & 86.7 & 6.7 & 93.3 \\\\ \\hline Onisha & 86.1 & 13.9 & 23.7 & 76.3 \\\\ \\hline Overri & 0.3 & 99.7 & 0.0 & 100.0 \\\\ \\hline Port Harcourt & 58.5 & 41.5 & 21.3 & 78.7 \\\\ \\hline Uyo & 11.3 & 88.7 & 1.1 & 98.9 \\\\ \\hline Warni & 19.1 & 80.9 & 5.6 & 94.4 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Distribution of S2 cells by Relative Wealth Index and MTT to the nearest CEmOC facility (%)\n\nFigure 3: **Relative wealth index and travel time of individual S2 cells in 15 cities in Nigeria (weekday 18\u201320 h).** The relative wealth index (RWI) and travel time to the nearest CEmOC facility of individual S2 cells in 15 cities in Nigeria are shown as a scatter plot. Each S2 cell is represented by a circle, with the colour of the circle\n\nmodelling of the two parameters. Second, RWI was only available at a resolution of 2.4 km, which might not be small enough to delineate a small slum within dense urban areas. Even when the granularity is 'enough', there is a risk of lack of predictive power of the included predictors to identify city slums: population density, topography-related characteristics, rainfall, road density, and mobile service usage. Third, we have assumed motorised transport as the mode of travel for our analysis and that it is available for all pregnant women when they need to commence their travel to care. While evidence suggests that the majority of pregnant women in emergency travel to facilities in some form of motorised transport, it is more likely that the least wealthy population will not have motorised transport of their own and will need additional time to get access to one before they can commence their journey to get access to care[20]. Fourth, we have focused our analysis only on the nearest facility despite recognising that sometimes pregnant women bypass such facilities. In the context of the inequalities that this paper aimed to address, it made sense to focus on the nearest only, as it represents the 'best-case' of the inequalities; travel time to the second and third nearest would only be worse[4]. Fifth, travel time covering distance exceeding 50 km and water-based travels were not computed. These were replaced with context-specific maximum values, instead of omitted, in our calculation. Sixth, we took the pragmatic decision to consider caesarean scenario capacity as a proxy for all EmOC services in public and private facilities. However, it is possible that not all EmOC services are necessarily available at facilities with capacity to provide caesarean sections. For example, assisted vaginal delivery or blood transfusion may not be available in hospitals at any time, whether public or private[31]. Finally, our urban delimitation was based on a qualitative assessment, as we included areas ranging from very dense to peri-urban. While this corresponds to the expansion of urban areas towards the peripheries and\n\nFig. 4: **Spatial distribution of public CEMOC and spatial distribution of relative wealth index at S2 cell level in Benin City, Kaduna, Ontisha, and Port Harcourt.

The intra-urban inequality patterns observed in our study might not be unique to Nigeria. In many other African cities that are set up in similar ways [3], health service provision, distribution, and their spatial relationship with the characteristics of communities remain work for future research. As cities grow, geographical accessibility must be top of the agenda, especially for the particularly vulnerable poor populations moving into these urban settings, many of whom already find the high cost to access and use EmOC a huge burden [5]. The service geo-accessibility gaps identified in this study can be used to guide/ priorititise attention and resources, as a matter of urgency, to the people and places most in need. While a range of interventions have been implemented in many African countries [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 the wealth index: a comparative analysis. _Health Policy Plan_**26**, 223-232 (2011).\n* [23] Banke-Thomas, A., Wright, K. & Collins, L.

However, with other factors, such as affordability critical for care access, it is important to explore accessibility across groups. We assessed CEmOC geographical accessibility by wealth status in the 15 most-populated Nigerian cities.\n\n**", "Methods": "** We mapped city boundaries, verified and geecocoded functional CEmOC facilities, and assembled population distribution for women of childbearing age and Meta's Relative Wealth Index (RWI). We used the Google Maps Platform's internal Directions Application Programming Interface to obtain driving times to public and private facilities. City-level median travel time (MTT) and number of CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min were summarised for peak and non-peak hours per wealth quintile. The correlation between RWI and MTT to the nearest public CEmOC was calculated.\n\n**Results** We show that MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility is lowest in the wealthiest 20% in all cities, with the largest difference in MTT between the wealthiest 20% and least wealthy 20% seen in Onitsha (26 vs 81 min) and the smallest in Wari (20 vs 30 min). Similarly, the average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min varies (11 among the wealthiest 20% and six among the least wealthy in Kano). In five cities, zero facilities are reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Those who live in the suburbs particularly have poor accessibility to CEmOC facilities.\n\n**Conclusions** Our findings show that the least wealthy mostly have poor accessibility to care. Interventions addressing CEmOC geographical accessibility targeting poor people are needed to address inequities in urban settings.\n\nWomen with complications of pregnancy and childbirth, including haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, sepsis, and abortion, require timely access to emergency obstetric care (EmOC), as any delay increases odds of poor pregnancy outcomes, including morbidity and mortality[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, huge challenges in accessing EmOC services. These challenges occur at a micro- (relating to the woman and her circumstances), meso- (relating to the health facility she is trying to access while in an emergency), and macro-level (relating to the way the health system is organised)'.\n\nIn 2009, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended that comprehensive EmOC (CEmOC), which is the full set of nine clinical and surgical evidence-based interventions, including caesarean section and blood transfusion, should be available in hospitals no further than 2-3 h travel time for most women [7]. However, there are ongoing debates about the adequacy of this travel time benchmark, as emerging evidence in urban African settings shows that women with pregnancy complications who are referred and require 30 min of travel to reach an appropriate level of care have significantly poorer outcomes than those who travelless than 10 min to care [8]. For their babies, direct travel to care of 10 min or more significantly increases their chance of being born dead [9].\n\nThere has been a wide perception that pregnant women in rural areas are particularly disadvantaged regarding access to care compared to those in urban areas [10]. Compared to rural areas, urban areas seemingly provide better geographical accessibility to infrastructure, services, and opportunities, including those for healthcare. However, this so-called urban advantage, which urban dwellers are deemed to have over rural ones in terms of infrastructure and outcomes, appears to be diminishing as urban planning is not catching up with population growth. The United Nations (UN) projects that by 2050, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas, and 40% of the projected additional 2.5 billion people living in urban areas worldwide will be in Africa [1]. Also, in many urban areas in Africa, though travel distances to the nearest health facilities are generally shorter, in reality, travel times to these facilities are often much longer than perceived because of poor roads, traffic congestion, haphazard urban planning, and growing informal settlements [11, 12, 13]. These issues pose particular challenges for pregnant women trying to access EmOC, especially with the current rapid rate of urbanisation, which means cities are saturating and populations are spreading into the surrounding peri-urban areas. However, the urban poor face even greater challenges, with the global community recognising at the 2016 United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in Quito that they are \"_excluded from access to services_\" [4, 5].\n\nPrevious research shows that poverty and long travel time to care are important determinants of health facility delivery by pregnant women in Africa, though, their influence on whether women give birth in a health facility varies within and across countries [17]. Before utilisation, a woman must be able to access the facility [17]. However, he ability to access care can also be influenced by her socioeconomic status [18]. For pregnant women in an emergency, geographical accessibility to EmOC potentially has life-or-death consequences. In terms of their pathway to care, this is also varied. Some travel directly to facilities that can provide the care they need, while others must be referred to reach such facilities [19, 20]. Robust research to show relationships between travel time to care needs to be able to reflect closer-to-reality pathways to care and be linkable to spatially represented wealth index data of the population, which is commonly used as a proxy for socio-economic status in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings [21]. For such research done in urban areas, they also need to capture the realites of travel in such settings. However, almost all modelled EmOC geographical accessibility studies do not incorporate urban challenges such as traffic, which leads to an underestimation of travel time [14, 20, 21]. To date, the lack of sufficiently high spatial resolution data for closer-to-reality travel time and population wealth index has precluded robust analysis comparing the extent of EmOC accessibility between the poor and the rich African urban areas. In this study, in which we address this knowledge gap by assessing CEmOC geographic accessibility by population wealth index in 15 of the most-populated Nigerian cities, we find that travel time to the nearest public \\(\\cemOC\\) facility is highest and number of functional public \\(\\cemOC\\) facilities is lowest for the least wealthy 20% in cities. We hope that the results will help identify if and where to intervene in action to improve EmOC geographical accessibility.\n\n## Methods\n\n### ", "Study setting": "\n\nNigeria is administratively divided into 36 states and a Federal Capital Territory. The states are divided into 774 local government areas (LGAs).

There has been increasing urbanisation in Nigeria, with some of its reported consequences being the movement of city populations to peripheral suburbs, expansion of informal settlements, increasing traffic, and an urban health crisis [9]. For many women living in urban areas of Nigeria, the majority will travel to EmOC facilities when in situations of emergency using motorised transport [22, 23]. We conducted this study in 15 Nigerian cities, all with a projected population of at least one million in 2022 (current) or 2030 (end term of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)) [24]: Aba, Abuja, Benin City, Ibadan, Ilorin, Jos, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Maiduguri, Ontisha, Owerri, Port Harcourt, Uyo, and Warri.

For each city, we selected all LGAs with areas of higher population density than their surroundings or marked as urban or suburban/peri-urban in the GHS layer [9].

The states are divided into 774 local government areas (LGAs). Each state has one or two major cities, with at least 20 of the major cities across the country having a population of over half a million [9].

Overall, the 15 cities accounted for 26% of the national population in 2022 [Supplementary Table 1].\n\n### Study design\n\nThis cross-sectional study involved the assembly of data to define extended city boundaries to include peripheral suburbs, verify CEmOC facility functionality and geographic location (latitude and longitude), and map population distribution for women of childbearing age (WoCBA) aged 15-49 years to estimate the travel time to care. Details of the methods used to collect and collate data for the study as well as estimate travel time, are described below and have been published in our Data Descriptor paper [9].\n\n### Data assembly\n\n#### Administrative boundaries\n\nAs the precise boundaries of the selected cities were not available for spatial analysis, we established the extended boundaries of each city (including suburbs) by the LGAs that make it up. For this, we spatially superimposed the vector file of the LGAs boundaries [9], WorldPop's gridded surface of the population (at 100 m\\({}^{2}\\) resolution) [9], Google Maps (Alphabet, Mountain View, California), and Global Human Settlement (GHS) layers showing the gridded surfaces of urban areas [9]. For each city, we selected all LGAs with areas of higher population density than their surroundings or marked as urban or suburban/peri-urban in the GHS layer [9]. Discussions amongst co-authors familiar with the cities helped improve the delineation process. Within the administrative boundaries, we considered the entire area comprising level 14 S2 cells, as defined by Google. The S2 cell optimises the splitting of spherical surfaces into grids of approximately equal size. Specifically, level 14 S2 cells are approximately 600 by 600 metres [1]. This resolution was selected to balance accuracy and computational power.\n\n#### Hospitals\n\nA list of hospitals in the 15 cities was first extracted from the 2018 Nigeria Health Facility Registry (NHFR) [9]. Information on the facility name, ownership, location (LGA and GPS coordinates), and operational status (open or closed) were retained from the NHFR. The NHFR data was supplemented by state-specific lists such as that of the Health Facilities Monitoring and Accreditation Agency in Lagos State [9] and by data gathered from stakeholders familiar with health service provision in the other states. We removed duplicates after combining the lists and assigning unique codes to each hospital. Data on service availability was obtained through a facility functionality assessment survey conducted with health facility administrators to specifically establish facilities that were operational 24 h a day and able to conduct caesarean sections (used as a proxy for CEmOC in this study, as capacity for other EmOC services provision is usually subsumed in capacity for caesarean sections). We also confirmed facility ownership (public--federal or state, or private--for-profit, not-for-profit, faith-based organisations, military, or police-owned facilities). The survey was conducted during in-person hospital visitations by trained research assistants using a short questionnaire. Data collection took place from March to August 2022. Our curated list of verified CEmOC facilities is publicly available [18, 22].\n\n \n\n**Population distribution.** We obtained the constrained version of population distribution of WoGBA at 1 km\\({}^{2}\\) spatial resolutions from WorldPop's open spatial demographic data portal\\({}^{\\#}\\). WorldPop uses dasymetric techniques to create the gridded surface by disaggregating 2006 census data from LGAs based on weights derived from covariates such as land use, land cover, and night-time lights\\({}^{\\#}\\). National estimates were projected to match United Nations Population Division 2022 estimates while adjusting for differences between rural and urban areas. Age and sex multipliers data from census and household data were then applied to the projected national estimates to derive the proportion of WoCBA nationally. Geospatial layers of various resolutions were resampled to 600 by 600 metres to match the spatial granularity of the 14 S2 cells\\({}^{\\#}\\).\n\n**Relative wealth.** We utilised Meta's Relative Wealth Index (RWI) as a measure of wealth at the level of S2 cell\\({}^{\\#}\\). This index estimates the relative wealth of the people living in each macro-region relative to others in the same country. The index is based on de-identified connectivity data, geospatial \"big\" data from satellites and other existing sensors, used to train a machine-learning algorithm that predicts microregional poverty. Data for Nigeria was based on a survey of 40,680 households in 899 unique survey locations (known as 'villages'). The survey included questions that assessed socio-economic circumstances of each household. RWI values are available for small areas (also referred to as micro-regions), each of approximately 2.4 km\\({}^{2}\\) in size\\({}^{\\#}\\). RWI for each S2 cell was taken from that of its nearest micro-region.\n\n**Computing travel time and geographical coverage**\n\nWe extracted travel times for each 14 S2 grid cell from the Google Maps Platform's internal Directions Application Programming Interface (API), which uses Machine-Learning models that leverage a range of inputs to estimate travel time\\({}^{\\#}\\). The travel times were based on motorised transport from each grid centre as the origin to the nearest CEmOC facilities by ownership (public and privited). Motorised transport was used as available evidence from the country showed that it was the most common means of transport to care for pregnant women in emergency\\({}^{\\#}\\)[27, 4]. For each ownership type, we derived travel times during the peak traffic scenario for weekdays 18-20 h for the off-peak traffic scenario for weekends 01-03 h. The curated dataset of closer-to-reality travel time estimates for all selected cities is publicly available\\({}^{\\#}\\)[34].\n\nTo provide summary statistics on the geographic accessibility of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5. We reported the median travel time (MTT) to the nearest CEmOC facility (1. public only, and 2. public or private), as well as the average number of reachable CEmOC facilities (1. public only, and 2. public or private), during weekday 6-8 pm by quintiles. We also compared the MITT and average number of reachable facilities between peak and off-peak travel scenarios by quintiles and by city.\n\nPearson correlation between RWI and travel time to the nearest public CEmOC was calculated for each city. We further grouped the S2 cells by RWI (Q1-Q2, vs Q3-Q5) and compared the percentage of S2 cells with travel time to the nearest public CEmOC longer than 60 min. We produced maps to illustrate the spatial distribution of wealth and shorter/longer travel time. Travel times for S2 cells exceeding 50 km away from their nearest target facility and those with no accessible road path to any facility were not computed; these were replaced with the maximum travel time specific to the city, traffic scenarios (peak or off-peak), and facility type (public, private, or private and private) for the purpose of correlation calculation.\n\nWe conducted analysis and visualisation as static maps with R version 4.2.0 (R Development Core Team, Auckland, New Zealand) and ArcMap (ESRI ArcGIS, Redlands, California, US). The data used are publicly available and described in detail elsewhere\\({}^{\\#}\\).\n\n**Ethics statement**\n\nEthics approval for the study was obtained from the National Health Research and Ethics Committee in Nigeria (NHREC/01/01/2007-11/04/2022) and the University of Greenwich Research and Ethics Committee (UREC/214.7.8). Informed consent was obtained from health facility administrators for the facility functionality assessment survey. However, Informed consent was not required for publicly available datasets on population distribution and RWI, which were secondarily used in this study.\n\n**Reporting summary**\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcross the 15 cities, 132,474 S2 cells were included [Table 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1-15]. We verified the existence, functionality, and location of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5.

We verified the existence, functionality, and location of CEmOC and its wealth-based equity, we used city-specific cut-off values to categorise S2 cells into quintiles--ranging from the least wealthy 20% to the wealthiest 20%, denoted as Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and Q5.

We also compared the MITT and average number of reachable facilities between peak and off-peak travel scenarios by quintiles and by city.\n\n**Results**\n\nAcEstimated population by 2030 ranges from 1.1 million in Maiduguri to 20.6 million in Lagos. The estimated population of WoCBA for 2022 was 11.5 million (6% of the country's overall population) [Table 1].\n\nIn 13 of 15 cities, MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility was lowest in the wealthiest 20% of cells. In Benin City, for instance, MTT in Q5 was 43 min versus over 60 min in Q1 and Q2. The largest difference between Q1 and Q5 was observed in Ontika (26 vs. 81 min), whilst the smallest difference was observed in Ontika (20 vs. 30 min). When incorporating private CEmOC facilities (i.e., MTT to nearest public or private facility), MTT for all quintiles in all cities reduced, though the magnitudes of the reductions varied. For example, reductions were relatively mild in all groups in Maiduguri and Abuja. Nonetheless, MTT in all groups and all cities dropped below 60 min, and in seven cities, including Abu, Uyo, Kano, Ilorin, Jos, Maiduguri, and Warri in all groups dropped below 30 min [Fig. 1].\n\nThe average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min was as high as 12 among the wealthiest 20% of cells in Kano, where reachable facilities totaled seven in Q1. In Lagos, Kaduna, Ontika, Port Harcourt, and Benin City, zero facilities were reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Lagos had the widest inequality gap for reachable public CEmOC facilities (nine in Q5 vs zero in Q1), followed by Ibadan and Kano. The top-inequality pattern (the wealthiest subgroup experiencing considerably better accessibility than other groups) appeared in Abuja, Jos, and Port Harcourt. With additional consideration of private CEmOC facilities, the number of reachable facilities exceeded 30 for all groups, including Q1, in Ibadan, Ilorin, Uyo, Kano, Owerri, and Aba. Lagos remained with the widest inequality gap, where 4 and 293 facilities were within reach under 30 min for the lowest and highest wealth quintiles, respectively [Fig. 1].\n\nAs a general pattern, MTT and the number of reachable facilities during peak and off-peak traffic were similar in most cities and wealth groups. However, some exceptions were noted. In Lagos, for instance, the number of reachable facilities within 60 min was nine during peak traffic and 16 during off-peak traffic in the wealthiest 20%. In Abuja, the number of reachable facilities during peak and off-peak traffic was eight and 11, respectively [Fig. 2].\n\nAll cities had negative correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI. The correlation coefficient was the largest in magnitude in Ontika (\\(r=-0.70,95\\%\\) CI [\\(-0.73\\),\\(-0.68\\)]) and smallest in Aba (\\(r=-0.26,95\\%\\) CI [\\(-0.30\\),\\(-0.22\\)]) [Fig. 3], where the percentages of the least wealth 40% of 52 cells that had MTT above 60 min were 86.1% and 0.3%, respectively [Table 2]. In Ontika, the locations of such cells spanned the southern part, whilst the MTT was within 60 min in the North, where RWI was generally higher [Fig. 4]. Alongside Ontisha, three other cities had over 60% poorer S2 cells, mostly in the city outskirts, with longer MTT of 60\\(+\\) minutes (Port Harcourt, Kaduna, and Benin City). In Warri,\n\nFig. 1: **Equiplot of geographic accessibility by relative wealth in 15 cities in Nigeria.****a** Median Travl Time (MTT) to the nearest public comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) facility in minutes in 15 cities in Nigeria by quintile of relative wealth. **b** MTT to the nearest public or private CEmOC facility in minutes.\n\n Maiduguri, Uyo, Ilorin, Kano, Owerri, and Aba, over 80% of the least wealthy 40% of cells had MTT \\(\\leq\\) 60 min [Fig. 3].\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis study assessed CEmOC geographical accessibility by population wealth index in 15 cities in Nigeria using closer-to-reality travel time estimates during peak and off-peak traffic times and to public and public or private facilities. Our study found that in 13 of 15 cities, MTT to the nearest public CEmOC facility was lowest in areas habited by the wealthiest 20% of the population. Similarly, the number of functional public CEmOC facilities that could be reached was typically the lowest amongst the poorest 20% of the urban population across cities, with the least wealthy 20% in some cities unable to reach one public facility within 60 min. The number of accessible facilities varied in some cities depending on travel periods (peak v. non-peak), and correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI were negative in all cities. Broadly, it appeared those who lived in the core center of the city had better accessibility to functional public CEmOC facilities, with a higher proportion of those with better accessibility being the wealthiest 60%.\n\nOur study revealed strong within-city inequities for CEmOC accessibility aligned with the RWI of places where urban dwellers are domiciled. The least wealthy 20% travel furthest to functional public CEmOC. We observed the largest difference in MTT between the wealthiest 20% and poorest 20% in Ohnisha (26 vs 81 min) and the smallest difference in Warri (20 vs 30 min). Similarly, the average number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min varied across cities. It was as high as 11 among the wealthiest 20% in Kano, while reachable facilities totalled six amongst the least wealthy. In some cities, including Lagos, Kaduna, Ontisha, Port Harcourt, and Benin City, zero facilities were reachable under 60 min for the least wealthy 20%. Reviewing the spatial distribution of where the least wealthy population live compared with the areas that have poor accessibility to functional public CEmOC facilities, it becomes clear that those who live in the suburbs are particularly vulnerable. This aligns with findings from a previous assessment of geographical accessibility, which recreated journeys of pregnant women who presented in an emergency in Lagos[1]. In our study, correlation coefficients between MTT to the nearest public CEmOC and RWI were negative in all cities, suggesting lower MTT from wealthier places.\n\nSome additional insights that can be gleaned from our study include that geographical accessibility, looking at peak and off-peak travel times, were similar for most cities. However, larger cities, such as Abuja, Kano, and Lagos, generally had worse accessibility in terms of the number of functional public CEmOC facilities that could be reached during peak traffic times. In a separate study, we showed that many slum areas, where many of the least wealthy populations are domiciled, have the worst accessibility to public sector care[1]. A previous study in Bangladesh found that variability in traffic congestion significantly affected travel time to care and availability of healthcare services for slum populations, with only 63% of the city's slum population able to reach emergency services within 60 min[1].\n\nThe inequities observed somewhat relate to the distribution of the facilities, with more functional ones situated more in the core of the cities than in the peripheral suburbs. For example, in Kano, where almost the entire city population could reach functional public CEmOC facilities within 60 min, there was a relatively even distribution of facilities across space. Although adding the private facilities reduced travel time and massively increased the number of available facilities within 60 min of travel for many cities, there remains a cost barrier in accessing care in such facilities for the least wealthy that needs to be considered[1, 2, 3]. In addition, concerns have been raised about the quality of EmOC available within the private sector[1]. Irrespective of the potential opportunity that private facilities bring to the health system, governments must continue strategically exploring opportunities to situate CEmOC facilities in areas of geographical access inequities. By leveraging evidence such as the one we have provided in this study, which can also be presented in a digital dashboard, policymakers will be able to identify optimal location for such facilities that guarantee the best\n\nFig. 2: **Geographic accessibility to the nearest public CEmOC facility in 15 cities in Nigeria by wealth quintile of S2 cells\u2014peak vs. off-peak. a Median travel time (MTT) to the nearest public comprehensive emergency obstetric care (CEmOC) facility during peak hours (weekday 18\u201320 h) and off-peak hours (weekend 01-03 h) shown as a scatter plot, with each circle corresponding to a wealth quintile in one of 15 cities in Nigeria. b Number of public CEmOC facilities reachable within 60 min** value for money, despite the cost of service provision, can be established [50, 51, 52, 53]. A public CEmOC facility in Lagos led to a 42-minute reduction in mean travel time in Lagos [6].\n\nThere are several strengths of our approach worth highlighting. First, our study was based on algorithmic outputs generated using Google Maps Platform's internal Directions API, the external version of which has been shown to offer closer-to-reality time estimates [14]. Only a handful of published studies have investigated the link between wealth and healthcare utilisation in LMIC settings, and even fewer have focused on explaining the socio-demographic inequality between wealth and healthcare accessibility [13, 17, 25, 43], with the few that looked at it, using mostly modelled travel time estimates which were less reflective of real-world travel, especially in the urban space [14]. Our analysis sheds light on the realistic geographic accessibility barriers that hindered the less wealthy more markedly; we hope this adds new insights to the evidence base of health inequality and health service planning and policy [53]. This approach can be scaled up to ensure the use of closer-to-reality travel time estimates is combined with other datasets to inform policy in urban Africa [1]. In addition, we have included only facilities verified as having the capacity to provide caesarean section, with previous analyses including all facilities and not specifically confirming service capacity. Furthermore, our approach reflected traffic variability, highlighting accessibility during peak and off-peak travel times, which is critical for a holistic understanding of accessibility in urban areas. Finally, we have used a finer spatial scale at 0.6 by 0.6 km for our analysis of travel time--an approach deemed by expert to ensure greater accuracy and robustness in model inputs for informing policy and decision-making [9].\n\nHowever, our results should be interpreted with certain limitations in mind. First, RWI was modelled on many predictors but did not include traffic. This permits our investigation into the relationship between RWI and TT. However, among the model predictors for RWI were population density, road density, and 'built-up' -ness [9]. All these play into traffic and travel time to some extent, which might mean some correlations in the\n\n\nTable 2: Distribution of S2 cells by Relative Wealth Index and MTT to the nearest CEmOC facility (%)\n\nFigure 3: **Relative wealth index and travel time of individual S2 cells in 15 cities in Nigeria (weekday 18\u201320 h).** The relative wealth index (RWI) and travel time to the nearest CEmOC facility of individual S2 cells in 15 cities in Nigeria are shown as a scatter plot. Each S2 cell is represented by a circle, with the colour of the circle\n\nmodelling of the two parameters. Second, RWI was only available at a resolution of 2.4 km, which might not be small enough to delineate a small slum within dense urban areas. Even when the granularity is 'enough', there is a risk of lack of predictive power of the included predictors to identify city slums: population density, topography-related characteristics, rainfall, road density, and mobile service usage. Third, we have assumed motorised transport as the mode of travel for our analysis and that it is available for all pregnant women when they need to commence their travel to care. While evidence suggests that the majority of pregnant women in emergency travel to facilities in some form of motorised transport, it is more likely that the least wealthy population will not have motorised transport of their own and will need additional time to get access to one before they can commence their journey to get access to care[20]. Fourth, we have focused our analysis only on the nearest facility despite recognising that sometimes pregnant women bypass such facilities. In the context of the inequalities that this paper aimed to address, it made sense to focus on the nearest only, as it represents the 'best-case' of the inequalities; travel time to the second and third nearest would only be worse[4]. Fifth, travel time covering distance exceeding 50 km and water-based travels were not computed. These were replaced with context-specific maximum values, instead of omitted, in our calculation. Sixth, we took the pragmatic decision to consider caesarean scenario capacity as a proxy for all EmOC services in public and private facilities. However, it is possible that not all EmOC services are necessarily available at facilities with capacity to provide caesarean sections. For example, assisted vaginal delivery or blood transfusion may not be available in hospitals at any time, whether public or private[31]. Finally, our urban delimitation was based on a qualitative assessment, as we included areas ranging from very dense to peri-urban. While this corresponds to the expansion of urban areas towards the peripheries and\n\nFig. 4: **Spatial distribution of public CEMOC and spatial distribution of relative wealth index at S2 cell level in Benin City, Kaduna, Ontisha, and Port Harcourt.

The intra-urban inequality patterns observed in our study might not be unique to Nigeria. In many other African cities that are set up in similar ways [3], health service provision, distribution, and their spatial relationship with the characteristics of communities remain work for future research. As cities grow, geographical accessibility must be top of the agenda, especially for the particularly vulnerable poor populations moving into these urban settings, many of whom already find the high cost to access and use EmOC a huge burden [5]. The service geo-accessibility gaps identified in this study can be used to guide/ priorititise attention and resources, as a matter of urgency, to the people and places most in need. While a range of interventions have been implemented in many African countries [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 the wealth index: a comparative analysis. _Health Policy Plan_**26**, 223-232 (2011).\n* [23] Banke-Thomas, A., Wright, K. & Collins, L.

The underlying mechanisms for the development and progression of the disease are complex and multifactorial, and a 'multiple-hit hypothesis' has been proposed for its prediction[11]. Increased lipid synthesis and accumulation, mainly characterized by an excess of triacylglycerectides (TGs), has been reported to occur from augmented the now biogenesis and insulin-resistant adipose tissue[12]. In turn, persistent steatosis can lead to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of immune cells[13, 14]. Associated pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic imbalances further aggravate the liver, leading to apoptosis, scaring, and fibrosis.\n\nTo elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of MASLD and MASH, appropriate experimental models need to be developed. Additionally, preclinical disease models are essential for drug discovery and testing. However, due to the multifactorial nature of steatohepatitis and its heterogeneity in humans, it is challenging to establish a preclinical model that closely resembles its pathophysiology and metabolism. Several dietary (nutritional), chemical (toxin-induced), and genetic mouse models or combinations thereof have been established[15, 16, 17]. Dietary mouse models include nutrient-deficient approaches such as methionine and choline-deficient diets (MCD), and high-fat diets (HFD). HFD-induced MASLD models with the addition of fructose and/or cholesterol (also called western diet (WD)) lead to a wide spectrum of conditions that closely resemble human MASLD pathophysiology, such as insulin resistance, liver inflammation, and fibrosis[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 7 \n\n### RNA sequencing\n\nTotal RNA purification from liver tissues was performed using the RNeasy* Mini kit (Qiagen). The tissues were removed from the RNA stabilization solution, weighed, and homogenized in a buffer. The liver lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Ethanol was added to bind the RNA to the RNeasy membrane, the contaminants were washed away and the RNA was eluted with RNAes-free water. Transcriptomics analysis was performed using bulk RNA barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) [40]. The RNA was reverse transcribed with specific barcoded oligo-dT primers. The samples were pooled and the cDNA was purified using the DNA clean and concentrator kit, treated with exonuclease I, and subjected to second-strand synthesis to generate double-stranded cDNA. The full-length double-stranded cDNA was purified and eluted with water. The sequencing libraries were prepared by tagmentation of full-length double-stranded cDNA, purification with DNA clean and concentrator kit, and then elution with water. Afterward, the tagmented library was amplified, and the size of fragments 200-1000 bp was selected and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.\n\n### Lipidomics analysis\n\nLiver tissues were homogenized in 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate by a Tissue layer (MM300 Tissue Layer Mixer Mill, Retsch) with a metal bead at a speed of 25 Hz for 2.5 min. The total protein content was assessed by BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad). The homogenates were extracted by methyl tert-butyl ether/methanol (7:2) containing an internal standard (IS) mixture [41, 42]. The IS mixture contained 100 pmol of PG 17:0/17:0, 1.1 mmol Clebster1/D7, 50 pmol of PG 17:0/17:0, 50 pmol of PA 17:0/17:0, 50 pmol of PG 17:0/17:0, 50 pmol of LPC 12:0, 50 pmol of LPS 13:0, 50 pmol of LPS 17:1, 50 pmol of LPE 17:1, 200 pmol of SM 18:12/12:0, 500 pmol of PC 17:0/17:0, 200 pmol of PE 17:0/17:0, 50 pmol of CF 18:12/17:0, 100 pmol of TG 17:0/17:0/17:0, 200 pmol of CE 17:0. After extraction, 20 mL of the organic phase was transferred to the 96-well plate, and evaporated using a speed vacuum (SpeedVac Concentrator, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The dried samples were re-suspended in 40 mL of 7:5 mM ammonium acetate in chloroform/methanol/propanol (1:24,v/v/v). The lipidomics analysis was performed on Orbitrap Explora 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with direct infusion, a TriVersa NanoMate ion source (Advin Biosciences). The 5 mL extracted sample was directly infused into the mass spectrometer using a gas pressure of 1.25 psi and a voltage of 0.95 kV. The data was acquired in both positive and negative ionization mode in a single run. The total delivery time was set at 5 min 25 s. To avoid initial spray instability, the closure delay was set at 20 s. The polarity switched from positive to negative mode 150 s after contact closure time.\n\nFor the analysis of BAs, LPLs, and MGs, the liver homogenates were mixed with IS mixture and extracted with ice-cold methanol. The IS mixture consisted of 1 uM of CA-6, CDCA-4d, DCA-4d, GGA-4d, GCDCA-4g, GCDCA-4d, GUDCA-4d, HIDCA-4g, HICCA-4d, TCA-4d, TCDCA-4d, TICDA-4d, TICDA-4d, TICDA-4d, UIDCA-4d, 4d ml of LPC 17:0, LPE 17:1, and 1 uM of LPG 17:1, MG 17:0\\({}^{\\circ}\\). The supernatant was collected and dried under vacuum (SpeedVac Concentrator, Thermo Fisher Scientific). dried samples were re-constituted in 40 mL of mobile phases A and B (1:1) mixture. Metabolite separation and detection were performed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) using Vanguish UHPLC-Orbitrap Explorius 240 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mobile phase A was 10 mM ammonium acetate plus 0.01% acetic acid in water and mobile phase B was 10 mM ammonium acetate plus 0.01% acetic acid in methanol. The chromatographic separation was performed on an ACOUITY UPLC BEH Shield RP 18 column (Waters) with a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. The applied ionization parameters were capillary voltage \\(-\\)2.5 kV, vaporization and ion transfer tube temperature set up at 300 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, sheath gas flow rate 55 arbitrary units (AU), auxiliary gas flow rate 10 AU, and sweep gas flow rate 0 AU. The high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis was performed in negative mode with a mass range of 300-1200 m/z, running under full MS-ddMS [2] analysis mode.\n\nFor the analysis of fatty acid oxidation and ketometabolism, the homogenates were mixed with IS and extracted with an ice-cold mixture of isopropanol acetonitrile (1:1) and 0.1% acetic acid. The IS consisted of 1.5 uM N-acetylaspartate acid-d3, 60 uM acetoacetic acid-13C2, 5 uM decanoic acid-d19, 15 uM L-glutumeric acid-d5, 2.5 uM glutard-L-carnitine-d3, 3 uM 3-hydroxybutyrate acid-d4, 0.5 uM L-kynurenne-4d, 10 uM L-lactic acid-d3, 7.5 uM L-leucine-d3, 1.9 uM L-phenylalanine-d5, 1.9 uM Paryloglutamic acid-d5, 0.5 uM serotonin-d4, 10 uM L-tryptophan-13C11,15N2, 20 uM threonine-13C6,2 and 8 uM L-valine-d8 [41]. The supernatant was collected, evaporated under vacuum (SpeedVac Concentrator, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and re-constituted in 100 uL of mobile phase A. The analysis was performed on Vanguish UHPLC-Orbitrap Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile system contained mobile phase A, 0.1% acetic acid in aqueous, and mobile phase B, 0.1% acetic acid in acetonitrile isopropanol (1:1), under the flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. ACOUITY UPLC BEH C8 column (Waters) was used for the chromatographic separation. The high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis was performed in both positive and negative ionization mode, with a mass range of 85-600 \\(m\\)/z, running under full MS-ddMS [2] analysis mode. The ionization parameters were as follows: capillary voltage +4.0 and -2.5 kV, heater and capillary temperature set up at 350 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, sheath gas flow rate 45 AU, auxiliary gas flow rate 15 AU and sweep gas flow rate 1 AU.\n\nXcalibur software 4.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for data acquisition and spectrum preview. MS chromatograms of intact lipids were extracted by LipidXplorer software 1.2.8.1\\({}^{\\circ}\\). TraceFinder software 5.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific) was used for the analysis of BAs, LPLs, MGs, fatty acid oxidation, and ketometabolism.\n\n### Respiration assay in isolated liver mitochondria\n\nOxygen flux was measured in liver homogenates by respiratory (Oxygen-2k-Orboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria). The 500 ug of homogenate was added to 2 mL of respiration buffer (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM K +-lactobionate, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.1), at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C). Oxidative phosphorylation was estimated with complex I (pyruvate 5 mM, malate 2 mM, glutamate 5 mM) and complex II (succinate 10 mM) substrates in the presence of ADP (2.5 mM). leak respiration was recorded after the addition of oligomycin (2.5 uM). For maximum uncoupled respiration, the proto-ophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) was titrated in 0.5 uM increments until maximal stimulation of respiration. The protocol was terminated by assessing non-mitochondrial respiration with the complex I and III inhibitors, rotencone (0.5 mM), and antimycin A (2.5 mM), respectively. Finally, the activity at complex IV was recorded with the artificial substrate N,N,N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (TMPD; 0.5 mM) and ascorbic acid (2 mM), and inhibited with azide (100 mM). Respiration states were corrected for non-mitochondrial respiration, and complex IV activity was corrected for azide inhibition.\n\n### Statistical tests\n\nFor transcriptomics, RNA-Seq count data was tested for differential gene expression between control and MASH mice samples using the DESeq2 method [40], including a Benjamini and Hochberg multiple testing correction. The adjusted \\(p\\)-value cutoff was set to 0.05 for further analysis. For lipidomics, statistical difference was assessed using the Wilcoxon two-sample test with false discovery rate (FDR) correction and considered statistically significant based on a threshold of 0.05. Missing values were imputed to 1/5 of the minimum sample value.\n\n### Datasets used in the study\n\nThe present analysis included transcriptome data from 12 studies (six human and six mouse models). The analyzed datasets were either generated in-house (WD\\(+\\)CCI4 vs. CTRL) or available from literature, spanning a number of different conditions and interventions. We classified the datasets based on their respective contrast in MASLD/MASH vs. control, and MASLD/MASH stage X vs. baseline MASLD/MASH for the human cases,and in dietary, chemical, or genetic intervention vs. control for the mouse cases (Table 1). We performed analysis on a total number of 11 comparisons for human and 15 for mouse models.\n\n### GEMs used in the study\n\nIn order for our results to be consistent and comparable across different organisms, we aimed to select two GEMs that are constructed on a homolog basis and are sufficiently equivalent in terms of encompassing genes, reactions, and metabolites. To this end, we selected the Human1 (version 1.12.0) and Mouse1 (version 1.3.0) metabolic models2,4. With the aim of making the two models equivalent, we reassigned certain reactions of the mouse model to other subsystems, namely: \"MAR20010\" to \"Isolated\", \"MAR20007\" to \"Purine metabolism\", \"MAR20002\" to \"Glycyosmbiolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series\", and \"MAR20005\",\", MAR20006\", and \"MAR20016\" to \"Transport reactions\". For additional consistency, we reassigned reaction \"MAR09933\" to \"Acrylglyceride metabolism\" in both models. All of the gene identifiers provided in both GEMs and all datasets were matched using groprific\" supplemented by manual curation.\n\nTo facilitate readability, we grouped certain pathways together for presentation in the manuscript figures. These groups were defined as follows: Beta-oxidation of fatty acids: Beta-oxidation of branched-chain fatty acids (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of di-unsaturated fatty acids (n-6) (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of di-unsaturated fatty acids (n-6) (peroxisomal), Beta-oxidation of even-chain fatty acids (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of even-chain fatty acids (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids (metochondrial), Beta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids (peroxisomal), Beta-oxidation of phytamic acid (peroxisomal), Beta-oxidation of only-unsaturated fatty acids (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (n-7) (mitochondrial), Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (n-9) (metochondrial), Beta-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids (n-9) (peroxisomal). Carnite shuttle: Carnite shuttle (cytosolic), Carnite shuttle (metochondrial), Carnite site shuttle (peroxisomal). Cholesterol biosynthesis 1 (Bloch pathway), Cholesterol biosynthesis 2, Cholesterol biosynthesis 3 (Kanddustch-Russell pathway). Fatty acid activation (cytosolic), Fatty acid activation (endoplasmic reticulum). Fatty acid biosynthesis: Fatty acid biosynthesis, Fatty acid biosynthesis (even-chain), Fatty acid biosynthesis (odd-chain), Fatty acid biosynthesis (unsaturated). Fatty acid desaturation: Fatty acid desaturation (even-chain), Fatty acid elongation: Fatty acid elongation (even-chain), Fatty acid desaturation (odd-chain). Glycosophilogly biosynthesis: Glycyosmbiolipid biosynthesis-gabolo series, Glycosophilogly biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series. It is important to note that TDMPA calculations and scoring were performed for each pathway separately without this grouping.\n\n### Transcriptomics-driven metabolic pathway analysis\n\nThe first step of TDMPA is the translation of relative gene expression ratios to corresponding relative reaction flux ratios, based on the definition of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules, as provided in the selected GEMs. Even though absolute gene expression does not directly correlate with reaction flux for all genes, the assumption that relative changes in gene expression between two conditions correlate with changes in reaction flux profiles has been shown to perform well[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, After calculating the reaction ratios, we then score pathways (or sub-systems as they are denoted in GEMs) based on the amount of perturbed reactions they encompass. To start with, we select a cutoff value in order to define which reactions are considered perturbed and which are not. Reactions are considered perturbed if they satisfy either \\(R_{i}\\)\\(>\\)\\(1+\\)_cutoff_ or \\(R_{i}\\)\\(<\\)\\(1/\\left(1+\\)_cutoff_\\(\\right)\\), where \\(R_{i}\\) is the reaction flux ratio of reaction i. In order to illustrate how this selection affects the results, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the cutoff selection (Supplementary Fig. S1-- \\(W\\)\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model). When considering all the reaction changes larger than one percent we observed changes in almost the entire metabolic network (129 out of 141 metabolic pathways affected). The number of affected pathways dropped steeply as the cutoff was increased, namely to 96 and 57, for changes larger than 50 and 100 percent, respectively. For changes larger than 200 percent the affected pathways were only 26. Since no clear argument can be made for the choice of a larger cutoff according to our research question, we decided to keep it as low as one percent to ensure that we do not exclude any potentially valuable information.\n\nFinally, the Pathway Reaction Score (PRS) is calculated as the percentage of perturbed reactions in the pathway, meaning the number of reactions that have an absolute computed ratio larger than the defined cutoff over the total number of reactions in the pathway. For each pathway, the PRS is calculated as:\n\n\\[\\textit{PRS}=\\frac{\\#\\textit{of perturbed reactions in pathway j}}{\\#\\textit{ of total reactions in pathway j}}\\] (1)\n\nWe additionally computed \\(p\\)-values for each pathway in order to evaluate their statistical significance. We used the hypergeometric test, which is based on the hypergeometric distribution, and describes the discreet probability of k successes in m random draws without replacement, from a population of total size M that contains K objects with that attribute. In our case, and for a single pathway i, M is the total number of reactions in all pathways of the GEM, K is the number of reactions in pathway i, m is the number of reactions calculated to be perturbed based on the selected cutoff, and k is the subset of m that belongs to pathway i. The probability for the over-representation of each pathway is then calculated as:\n\n\\[p(k)=\\frac{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}K\\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}M-K\\\\ m-k\\end{array}\\right)}{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}M\\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\binom{i}{j}\\) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe computed \\(p\\)-values were subjected to a FDR correction, using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure [5].\n\nIt is usual that within one pathway some reactions are upregulated and others downregulated in disease conditions. In a number of these cases, the mean value of the pathway's reaction fold-changes is close to zero, but the pathway is still very perturbed. Thus, it is not always straightforward to define if a pathway is up- or downregulated and to avoid the loss of information. To this end, we additionally calculated the normalized Euclidean distance for each pathway from healthy (control) conditions as a measure of pathway perturbation (Supplementary Fig. S2).\n\nIn order to evaluate the similarity between datasets, we selected Cohen's kappa coefficient as a metric [3]. Cohen's kappa is a statistic that is traditionally used to evaluate inter-rater reliability for categorical scales. For this, we defined three distinct categories for each reaction flux ratio as calculated by TDMPA, specifically \"increased\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(>\\)1), \"decreased\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(<\\)1), and \"unchanged\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(=\\) 1). Using these definitions, we constructed the confusion matrix for each metabolic pathway of the GEM, using the WD \\(+\\)CCI4 model as later #1 and all the human datasets sequentially as raster #2, and then calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient accordingly.\n\n### Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Results\n\n### Histological characterization of WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model\n\nA vital first step in preclinical MASH studies is the selection of the most suitable animal model in order to address the specific research question. We decided to use a WD mouse model supplemented by CCI4 (WD\\(+\\)CCI4, see Methods) that accurately simulates the histological, immunological, and transcriptional characteristics of human MASH [7]. The model showed 50-fold increase in the lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation, 4-fold increase in fibrosis, and >90% micro- and macro-veicular steatosis in the livers of MASH mice as well as the presence of ballooned hepatocytes (Fig. 1). Liver transaminases (ALT and AST), and total cholesterol were significantly elevated in the plasma of the WD\\(+\\)CCI4-induced MASH model compared to the control group (Fig. 1).\n\nMetabolic pathway alteration signatures in various stages of human MASH/MASH progression and various liver damage mouse models\n\nIn order to assess the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model's metabolic resemblance to human MASH and its suitability for metabolic intervention design, we examined the changes in metabolic pathways that occur in MASH. We investigated multiple publically available datasets covering various stages of progression of human MASH to MASH across the full histological range from normal liver tissue to MASH with severe fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). To evaluate the changes in each pathway, we used TDMPA to calculate the changes in enzymatic reactions based on differential gene expression for all datasets (see Methods). Our results suggest that different aspects of lipid metabolism are severely altered throughout the various stages of the disease. To assess the similarity of the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model to human MASH, we calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient [3] for each pathway and human dataset (see Methods). The WD\\(+\\)CCI4 model exhibits a good agreement with the human MASH vs. control datasets, especially with the human MASH vs. CTRL (2) dataset. This dataset corresponds to a fibrosis score of F1 (80% F1, range F0-F2), matching the fibrosis score of the mouse model. It has been proposed that Cohen's kappa values should be interpreted as follows: values \\(\\leq\\) 0 as indicating no agreement, 0.01-0.20 as slight, 0.21-0.40 as fair, 0.41-0.60 as moderate, 0.61-0.80 as substantial, and 0.81-1.00 as almost perfect agreement [3]. According to this scale, 57% of metabolic pathways between human MASH and the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model exhibit moderate to substantial or better agreement, including most pathways related to lipid metabolism such as acyl-CoA hydrolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, arachidonic acid, eicosanoid, leukotriene, prostaglandin, glycololipid, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Finally, 25% of the pathways exhibit slight agreement and 18% no agreement between the two datasets.\n\nWe additionally compared the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 model to other proposed mouse models spanning various intervention methods to induce liver damage (Supplementary Fig. S2). We categorized these models into three distinct classes of interventions, namely dietary, chemical, and genetic. The majority of them are in good agreement with each other and present upregulated pathways of phospholipids, nucleotides, keratan sulfate, and cholesterol esters. All models exhibit altered fatty acid oxidation, and most result in altered bile acid biosynthesis, and sphingolipid, leukotriene, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis are perturbedly in the most severe dietary models. Overall, the HFD, WD, streptozotocin intoxication (STZ), and GLMP knockout mouse models exhibit the least severe metabolic changes. The model resulting in the most shifts within the metabolic network is the chronic CCI4 intoxication model, highlighting the potency of CCI4 as an acute liver damage agent.\n\n TDMPA shows substantial alterations in lipid metabolism in WD \\(+\\)CC4 model and close resemblance to human MASH\n\nAs the next step in TDMPA, we scored metabolic pathways based on the number of altered metabolic reactions in each of them (see Methods). The results of TDMPA for the WD\\(+\\)CC4 mouse model reveal multiple metabolic pathways that are significantly altered and scored highly (Fig. 2a). Most of the top-ranked pathways are related to lipid metabolism, especially fatty acids (beta-oxidation, biosynthesis, activation, desaturation, oxidation, metabolism), bile acids (biosynthesis and recycling), cholesterol (biosynthesis, metabolism, esterification),\n\nFig. 1: **Effect of WD \\(+\\) CC4 on mouse liver.****A** Microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin (HRE)-stained liver sections showing diffuse macro-vascular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and the presence of ballooned hepatocytes in the WD \\(+\\)CC4 group. **B** Histological scoring of the WD\\(+\\)CC4 group livers, given as median values. Values in parentheses denote the range of values across all mice. Coil Red O staining comparing neutral lipid content of control and WD\\(+\\)CC4 group (unpaired \\(t\\)-test; phospholipids (biosynthesis and metabolism), TGs (biosynthesis), and the carnitine shuttle, as well as oxidative phosphorylation. We performed the same analysis for human MASH F1 vs. control (corresponding to dataset MASH vs. CTRL (2) in Table 1) and MASH progression (MASH F3 vs. MASLD) datasets (Fig. 2b, c, respectively). It is clear that the mouse model matches the human MASH vs. control results very well, but is less similar to MASH progression results. This becomes even more apparent when comparing the overlap of significantly altered pathways between the three datasets (Fig. 2d). We can discern a large overlap between altered metabolic pathways in mouse and human MASH, but the resemblance of altered metabolic pathways is less in human MASH progression compared to a mouse model. Out of the identified top-scored pathways, 54% of overall changes in metabolic pathways are similar in the human MASH and WD+CC4 mouse model. This is reduced to 11% when looking into MASLD to MASH progression. Specifically in terms of metabolic pathways, only five are commonly predicted as perturbed across all three datasets, namely fatty acid desaturation, and acylglycerides, estrogen, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. Between the mouse model and human MASH vs. control, 43 pathways are common, while 18 and 11 are only predicted in the mouse and human MASH vs. control datasets, respectively. The 43 common pathways include acyl-CoA hydrolysis, acylglycerides metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis and recycling, cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism, and esterification, glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, and\n\nFig. 2: **TDMPA results for the compared cases.****a** WJD+CC4 mouse model vs. Control, **b** human MASH vs. Control, **c** human MASH F3 vs. MASLD (MASH progression). **d** Corresponding Venn diagram of the statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) altered pathways across the three datasets.

The mouse-only pathways include chondro sulfate degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and parts of the carnitine shuttle, fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation, oxidation, and beta-oxidation. Similarly, the human MASH vs. control-only pathways include nicotine and nicotinamide metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism, heparan sulfate degradation, and various aminoacid metabolic pathways. The MASH progression dataset results in three metabolic pathways not predicted in neither mouse nor human MASH vs. control, namely glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, blood group biosynthesis, and transport reactions.\n\nHaving identified the most relevant pathways, we then investigated the changes in the enzymatic reaction level (Fig. 3). Every participating reaction in the novo acylyllyceride biosynthesis, especially TG biosynthesis, was upregulated. TG degradation was also increased, especially in chylomicrons. Similarly, most reactions in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis were upregulated. In addition, cholesterol biosynthesis as well as the formation and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters were severely perturbed. These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting increased de novo biogenesis and accumulation of TGs in MASH\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and severely impacted cholesterol homeostasis\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\). Another part of the metabolic network that showed prominent changes in MASH was mitochondrial metabolism, specifically the\n\nFig. 3: **Metabolic network of the most affected pathways in mouse MASH model and corresponding reaction change ratios.** Green and red colors denote a calculated increase and decrease of reaction flux, respectively.

We observed that the carnitine shuttle shows increased activity in MASH in both binding and transporting fatty acids to the mitochondrial matrix. Subsequently, fatty acid beta-oxidation is quite affected. Finally, oxidative phosphorylation is disrupted in both the electron transport chain and ATP synthase parts. This is in agreement with multiple reports of mitochondrial dysregulation and oxidative stress playing a substantial part in MASH\\({}^{1940}\\).\n\nCompromised mitochondrial functions and bioenergetics in MASH lead to disruption of fatty acid beta-oxidation and oxidative stress\n\nAs we observed substantial alterations related to mitochondrial functions, we performed two functional assays focusing on mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty acid oxidation in order to confirm our findings. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of MASH mice showed reduced complex1 and II-driven respiration as well as maximum respiration. Complex IV was the most affected in MASH livers as shown by its independent activity measurement using the artificial substrates (TMPD+ascorbate) (Fig. 4a). Since pyruvate is the terminal glycolysis product that enters mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate complex (MPC), we examined whether the expression of MPC was affected in the MASH mouse liver. In the immunoblotting assessment, both subunits of MPC were downregulated in MASH mitochondria, indicating that not only the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes was decreased significantly, but also pyruvate entry into mitochondria was lowered in MASH livers compared to control (Fig. 4b).\n\nWe additionally investigated whether fatty acid oxidation was affected in the MASH mouse livers. Respiratory provided a suitable tool to measure fatty acid oxidation since complete oxidation of a fatty acid ends in ATP generation and hence oxygen consumption via the ETC. Palinvolt-carnitine was used as a substrate whereas malate served as a counter ion. As expected, mitochondria isolated from the liver of MASH mice had lower fatty acid oxidation compared to control mitochondria (Fig. 4c). Fatty acid uptake into the mitochondria occurs via the carnitine shuttle. Carnitineine palmitvolttransferase (CPT1)-1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane binds carnitine to the fatty acids to enable entry into the intermembrane space. Subsequently, CPT-2, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, removes carnitine and leads the fatty acid to its oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, we assessed whether the expression of CPT1s was affected in the MASH livers. Although the expression of CPT1a remained unchanged, CPT2 expression was reduced significantly in the MASH livers (Fig. 4d). It is interesting to note that while we confirmed a significant reduction in fatty acid beta-oxidation in the mitochondrial assay, TDMPA had predicted an increase of the pathway activity. This is due to the fact that TDMPA is a direct mapping of transcription-level changes and it does not always correspond to actual changes on the enzymatic and flux levels. However, the goal of TDMPA is to provide a first estimation of those changes and, most importantly, to direct our focus to the most affected metabolic pathways. In this respect, TDMPA correctly predicted major disruption in the mitochondrial metabolism during MASH. The occasional mismatch of the direction of change for each reaction can be attributed to cellular dynamics and molecular organization that cannot be captured solely\n\nFigure 4: **Effect of WD \\(+\\) CCI on (I) mitochondrial bioenergetics and (II) fatty acid oxidation.** A high-resolution respiratory of oxygen consumption (O2 flux) in mitochondria in liver homogenates of control vs. WD+CC4 group. **I** Immunoblot showing expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC1 and MPC2 in liver homogenates.

We performed metabolic profiling within the targeted pathways and identified and quantified over 500 metabolites in mouse liver tissues (see Methods). In total, 252 metabolites were significantly different in the liver between control and MASH (Supplementary Data 1). Specifically, a large number of lipids were significantly different between the control and MASH groups (Fig. 5a, b). Acylarunites were decreased significantly in the MASH group compared to control. This is in agreement with the above-mentioned alterations in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway and reduction in mitochondrial CPT2 expression. Conversely, a large number of TGs, diacylglycer correlates (DGs), monoacylglycer correlates (MGs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs), and cholesterol esters (CEs) were increased in MASH. Most bile acids (BAs) and lysophospholipids (LPLs) were also increased significantly in MASH. However, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) exhibited a mixed behavior. The most changes were observed in TGs, LPLs, phospholipids (PLs) (especially PEs), and acylaramines (Fig. 5b, c). Furthermore, we observed alterations of conjugated bile acids including taurondedeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid-sulfate (TCDCA-S), tauroduc acid 3-sulfate (TCA-S), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), and tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TMCA). The majority of the conjugated bile acids were significantly increased in MASH, which supports the TDMPA prediction of perturbed bile acid pathways (Fig. 2a).\n\nIn accordance with the changes of significant lipids in MASH, we further assessed the fatty acyl (FA) chain length composition in hepatic TGs, DGs, MGs, CEs, PLs, and LPLs (Fig. 6). The majority of altered esterified FAs in MASH were saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids such as FA 18:1, FA 16:0, and FA 16:1 (Fig. 6a). Specifically, oleic acid (FA 18:1) was increased in all detected lipid species. FA 20:3, FA 20:4, FA 22:4, and FA 22:5 within PLs were also increased significantly (Fig. 6b). These fatty acids are produced via desaturation and elongation of linoleic acid. These findings support the prediction of upregulated FA desaturation and FA elongation using the TDMPA approach.\n\n## Discussion\n\nMASH is one of the most prevalent liver diseases worldwide. Despite several developments in animal models, an animal model that resembles the relevant pathophysiology and metabolism needs to be established to better identify targets for treatment and drug testing. Several mouse models of MASH and their histological characterizations have been studied. However, the extent to which their metabolic alterations resemble those in humans remains poorly described. Further evaluation is needed to assess the resemblance of metabolic alterations in animal models to human conditions.\n\nCurrently, developed mouse models include dietary, chemically, and genetically induced MASH models. HFD/WD-induced models exhibit the observed metabolic changes across the spectrum of MASH and MASH but might require many weeks of feeding to achieve the desired histopathology[21]. Chemical intoxication leads to fibrosis much faster; however, those models typically do not result in obesity, steatosis, and insulin resistance[13, 14]. Thus, these models are a good way to study\n\nFigure 5: ** Metabolic changes in MASH vs. healthy mouse liver tissue.****a** PCA plot, **b** volcano plot, **c** heatmap of the most changed lipids. MASH metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatohepatitis, PCA principal component analysis. (MASH \\(n=17\\), control \\(n=9\\)).\n\n physical features of liver damage and fibrosis, but potentially not very helpful to study the disease onset. A combination of WD and hepatotoxins to induce fibrosis provides a good alternative for faster disease development while preserving the phenotype[7]. We hypothesized that this approach could lead to similar metabolic changes to human MASH, thus we used the already-established mouse model to test our hypothesis. In order to evaluate the resemblance of this model to human MASH regarding metabolic alterations, we developed TDMPA using genome-scale metabolic models and transcriptomics data and further confirmed our results using functional assays, lipidomics, and metabolomics analysis. Using TDMPA, we were able to map gene expression changes to metabolic reaction rate changes, and estimate the changes across the metabolic pathways. By evaluating the highest-scoring pathways, we defined the metabolic space where most changes occur in disease development and progression, obtaining valuable insights into the metabolic fingerprint of MASH.\n\nFigure 6: **Fatty acyl chain lengths of significantly altered lipids in MASH vs. healthy mouse liver tissue.** A Distribution per the direction of change and lipid class, **b** Box plots of log2-fold-changes per lipid class. The solid line denotes the median of the distribution and the upper and lower hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles, respectively (Tukey representation).

(MASH \\(n=17\\), control \\(n=9\\)).\n\n An essential aspect of metabolic pathway analysis is the ability to attain a certain level of granularity in the interpretation of the results, which is often lacking in gene expression analyses. We calculated the changes per metabolic reaction based on gene associations and then scored the metabolic pathways accordingly. TDMPA for the WD+CC4-induced MASH mouse model revealed that many aspects of lipid metabolism are severely affected, which can be grouped into roughly ten pathway families for further investigation. These include bile acid biosynthesis and recycling, fatty acid beta-oxidation, biosynthesis, and metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism, and esterification, leukotriene and arachidonic acid metabolism, carnitine shuttle, oxidative phosphorylation, phospholipid biosynthesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and the metabolism of multiple amino acids. We performed the same analysis for human MASH vs. control (Fig. 2b) and MASH progression (MASH F3 vs. MASLD) datasets (Fig. 2c). We observed that the mouse model resembles the human MASH results exceptionally well when compared to control (Fig. 2a vs. b), but the resemblance was less pronounced when compared to human MASH progression results (Fig. 2a vs. c). We can discern a large overlap between the mouse and human MASH vs. control pathways, but the human MASH progression pathways are quite different from both other cases. It is very important to define well the purpose of using animal models in investigating MASH development or progression. It is worth mentioning that the focus of this study was on metabolic alterations that resemble MASH in humans.\n\nSince we observed multiple changes in mitochondrial function, we performed two assays to evaluate the prediction. We confirmed that mitochondrial respiration and oxidation processes are disturbed in MASH mouse liver. These findings support previous hypotheses that mitochondria are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of MASHD, and could be a key player in its progression and regression\\({}^{\\text{\\text{\\textregistered}},\\text{\\textregistered}}\\). It is important to note that TDMPA predictions in terms of the direction of changes might not always reflect actual changes in the enzymatic and flux levels, since TDMPA is a direct mapping of transcription-level changes. Nevertheless, TDMPA's value lies in directing our focus to the most affected metabolic pathways and should be accompanied by enzymatic activity assessment and functional assays. Thus, TDMPA findings were further confirmed by lipidomics and metabolomics of the liver. More than 250 metabolites related to enzymatic reactions within the identified pathway families were significantly different in the MASH liver compared to the control. TGs were shown to be especially increased in MASH, thus further confirming the predicted increase of de novo acylglyceride biosynthesis. The increase of primary bile acids and conjugated bile acids has been reported in a previous study of MASH\\({}^{\\text{\\textregistered}}\\). Further assessment of the FA chain length composition in hepatic TG, DGAs, GCs, EEs, PIs, and LPIs showed an increase in saturated and monomustarted fatty acids such as FA 18:1, FA 16:0, and FA 16:1. Specifically, oleic acid (FA 18:1) was increased in all detected lipid species.\n\nThese results taken together shed light on metabolic pathways that are commonly changed in human and selected mouse models. Our comprehensive assessment provides additional evidence that WD +CC4-induced MASH is an appropriate mouse model for the study of human MASH pathophysiology and metabolism, confirming metabolic and functional resemblance. While TDMPA is limited by GEM annotation and exclusion of several metabolic processes such as signaling, it demonstratively offers an important level of granularity for the study of metabolic pathways in metabolic disorders and facilitates the direct mapping of changes on the gene expression level to metabolic reactions. Additionally, it is a valuable tool for defining metabolic space and better experimental design for lipidomics and metabolomics approaches in both animal models and humans. Finally, TDMPA can be used for the consistent comparison and evaluation of preclinical models, especially for targeting specific enzymes/ metabolic pathways. Accurate preclinical models and suitable methodologies to study them will enable and facilitate drug discovery and testing, identification of risk factors, development of better treatment strategies such as drug combination, and ultimately reduce the global burden of liver disease.\n\n## Data availability\n\nRNA-seq data files from the present study have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession number GSE230639.

We performed analysis on a total number of 11 comparisons for human and 15 for mouse models.\n\n### ", "GEMs used in the study": "", "Transcriptomics-driven metabolic pathway analysis": " reveals similar alterations in lipid metabolism in mouse MASH model and human\n njury, advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The underlying mechanisms for the development and progression of the disease are complex and multifactorial, and a 'multiple-hit hypothesis' has been proposed for its prediction[11]. Increased lipid synthesis and accumulation, mainly characterized by an excess of triacylglycerectides (TGs), has been reported to occur from augmented the now biogenesis and insulin-resistant adipose tissue[12]. In turn, persistent steatosis can lead to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced activation of immune cells[13, 14]. Associated pro-inflammatory signaling and metabolic imbalances further aggravate the liver, leading to apoptosis, scaring, and fibrosis.\n\nTo elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of MASLD and MASH, appropriate experimental models need to be developed. Additionally, preclinical disease models are essential for drug discovery and testing. However, due to the multifactorial nature of steatohepatitis and its heterogeneity in humans, it is challenging to establish a preclinical model that closely resembles its pathophysiology and metabolism. Several dietary (nutritional), chemical (toxin-induced), and genetic mouse models or combinations thereof have been established[15, 16, 17]. Dietary mouse models include nutrient-deficient approaches such as methionine and choline-deficient diets (MCD), and high-fat diets (HFD). HFD-induced MASLD models with the addition of fructose and/or cholesterol (also called western diet (WD)) lead to a wide spectrum of conditions that closely resemble human MASLD pathophysiology, such as insulin resistance, liver inflammation, and fibrosis[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 7 \n\n### RNA sequencing\n\nTotal RNA purification from liver tissues was performed using the RNeasy* Mini kit (Qiagen).

To this end, we selected the Human1 (version 1.12.0) and Mouse1 (version 1.3.0) metabolic models2,4. With the aim of making the two models equivalent, we reassigned certain reactions of the mouse model to other subsystems, namely: \"MAR20010\" to \"Isolated\", \"MAR20007\" to \"Purine metabolism\", \"MAR20002\" to \"Glycyosmbiolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series\", and \"MAR20005\",\", MAR20006\", and \"MAR20016\" to \"Transport reactions\".

Glycosophilogly biosynthesis: Glycyosmbiolipid biosynthesis-gabolo series, Glycosophilogly biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series. It is important to note that TDMPA calculations and scoring were performed for each pathway separately without this grouping.\n\n### Transcriptomics-driven metabolic pathway analysis\n\nThe first step of TDMPA is the translation of relative gene expression ratios to corresponding relative reaction flux ratios, based on the definition of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) rules, as provided in the selected GEMs. Even though absolute gene expression does not directly correlate with reaction flux for all genes, the assumption that relative changes in gene expression between two conditions correlate with changes in reaction flux profiles has been shown to perform well[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, After calculating the reaction ratios, we then score pathways (or sub-systems as they are denoted in GEMs) based on the amount of perturbed reactions they encompass. To start with, we select a cutoff value in order to define which reactions are considered perturbed and which are not. Reactions are considered perturbed if they satisfy either \\(R_{i}\\)\\(>\\)\\(1+\\)_cutoff_ or \\(R_{i}\\)\\(<\\)\\(1/\\left(1+\\)_cutoff_\\(\\right)\\), where \\(R_{i}\\) is the reaction flux ratio of reaction i. In order to illustrate how this selection affects the results, we performed a sensitivity analysis on the cutoff selection (Supplementary Fig. S1-- \\(W\\)\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model). When considering all the reaction changes larger than one percent we observed changes in almost the entire metabolic network (129 out of 141 metabolic pathways affected). The number of affected pathways dropped steeply as the cutoff was increased, namely to 96 and 57, for changes larger than 50 and 100 percent, respectively. For changes larger than 200 percent the affected pathways were only 26. Since no clear argument can be made for the choice of a larger cutoff according to our research question, we decided to keep it as low as one percent to ensure that we do not exclude any potentially valuable information.\n\nFinally, the Pathway Reaction Score (PRS) is calculated as the percentage of perturbed reactions in the pathway, meaning the number of reactions that have an absolute computed ratio larger than the defined cutoff over the total number of reactions in the pathway. For each pathway, the PRS is calculated as:\n\n\\[\\textit{PRS}=\\frac{\\#\\textit{of perturbed reactions in pathway j}}{\\#\\textit{ of total reactions in pathway j}}\\] (1)\n\nWe additionally computed \\(p\\)-values for each pathway in order to evaluate their statistical significance. We used the hypergeometric test, which is based on the hypergeometric distribution, and describes the discreet probability of k successes in m random draws without replacement, from a population of total size M that contains K objects with that attribute. In our case, and for a single pathway i, M is the total number of reactions in all pathways of the GEM, K is the number of reactions in pathway i, m is the number of reactions calculated to be perturbed based on the selected cutoff, and k is the subset of m that belongs to pathway i. The probability for the over-representation of each pathway is then calculated as:\n\n\\[p(k)=\\frac{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}K\\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)\\left(\\begin{array}{c}M-K\\\\ m-k\\end{array}\\right)}{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}M\\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)}\\] (2)\n\nwhere \\(\\binom{i}{j}\\) is the binomial coefficient.\n\nThe computed \\(p\\)-values were subjected to a FDR correction, using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure [5].\n\nIt is usual that within one pathway some reactions are upregulated and others downregulated in disease conditions. In a number of these cases, the mean value of the pathway's reaction fold-changes is close to zero, but the pathway is still very perturbed. Thus, it is not always straightforward to define if a pathway is up- or downregulated and to avoid the loss of information. To this end, we additionally calculated the normalized Euclidean distance for each pathway from healthy (control) conditions as a measure of pathway perturbation (Supplementary Fig. S2).\n\nIn order to evaluate the similarity between datasets, we selected Cohen's kappa coefficient as a metric [3]. Cohen's kappa is a statistic that is traditionally used to evaluate inter-rater reliability for categorical scales. For this, we defined three distinct categories for each reaction flux ratio as calculated by TDMPA, specifically \"increased\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(>\\)1), \"decreased\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(<\\)1), and \"unchanged\" (\\(R_{i}\\)\\(=\\) 1). Using these definitions, we constructed the confusion matrix for each metabolic pathway of the GEM, using the WD \\(+\\)CCI4 model as later #1 and all the human datasets sequentially as raster #2, and then calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient accordingly.\n\n### ", "Reporting summary": "\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## ", "Results": "\n\n### ", "Histological characterization of WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model": "\n\nA vital first step in preclinical MASH studies is the selection of the most suitable animal model in order to address the specific research question. We decided to use a WD mouse model supplemented by CCI4 (WD\\(+\\)CCI4, see Methods) that accurately simulates the histological, immunological, and transcriptional characteristics of human MASH [7]. The model showed 50-fold increase in the lipid accumulation, lobular inflammation, 4-fold increase in fibrosis, and >90% micro- and macro-veicular steatosis in the livers of MASH mice as well as the presence of ballooned hepatocytes (Fig. 1). Liver transaminases (ALT and AST), and total cholesterol were significantly elevated in the plasma of the WD\\(+\\)CCI4-induced MASH model compared to the control group (Fig. 1).\n\nMetabolic pathway alteration signatures in various stages of human MASH/MASH progression and various liver damage mouse models\n\nIn order to assess the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model's metabolic resemblance to human MASH and its suitability for metabolic intervention design, we examined the changes in metabolic pathways that occur in MASH. We investigated multiple publically available datasets covering various stages of progression of human MASH to MASH across the full histological range from normal liver tissue to MASH with severe fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). To evaluate the changes in each pathway, we used TDMPA to calculate the changes in enzymatic reactions based on differential gene expression for all datasets (see Methods). Our results suggest that different aspects of lipid metabolism are severely altered throughout the various stages of the disease. To assess the similarity of the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model to human MASH, we calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient [3] for each pathway and human dataset (see Methods). The WD\\(+\\)CCI4 model exhibits a good agreement with the human MASH vs. control datasets, especially with the human MASH vs. CTRL (2) dataset. This dataset corresponds to a fibrosis score of F1 (80% F1, range F0-F2), matching the fibrosis score of the mouse model. It has been proposed that Cohen's kappa values should be interpreted as follows: values \\(\\leq\\) 0 as indicating no agreement, 0.01-0.20 as slight, 0.21-0.40 as fair, 0.41-0.60 as moderate, 0.61-0.80 as substantial, and 0.81-1.00 as almost perfect agreement [3]. According to this scale, 57% of metabolic pathways between human MASH and the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 mouse model exhibit moderate to substantial or better agreement, including most pathways related to lipid metabolism such as acyl-CoA hydrolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis and elongation, arachidonic acid, eicosanoid, leukotriene, prostaglandin, glycololipid, phospholipid, and sphingolipid metabolic pathways. Finally, 25% of the pathways exhibit slight agreement and 18% no agreement between the two datasets.\n\nWe additionally compared the WD\\(+\\)CCI4 model to other proposed mouse models spanning various intervention methods to induce liver damage (Supplementary Fig. S2). We categorized these models into three distinct classes of interventions, namely dietary, chemical, and genetic. The majority of them are in good agreement with each other and present upregulated pathways of phospholipids, nucleotides, keratan sulfate, and cholesterol esters. All models exhibit altered fatty acid oxidation, and most result in altered bile acid biosynthesis, and sphingolipid, leukotriene, and arachidonic acid metabolism. Cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis are perturbedly in the most severe dietary models. Overall, the HFD, WD, streptozotocin intoxication (STZ), and GLMP knockout mouse models exhibit the least severe metabolic changes. The model resulting in the most shifts within the metabolic network is the chronic CCI4 intoxication model, highlighting the potency of CCI4 as an acute liver damage agent.\n\n TDMPA shows substantial alterations in lipid metabolism in WD \\(+\\)CC4 model and close resemblance to human MASH\n\nAs the next step in TDMPA, we scored metabolic pathways based on the number of altered metabolic reactions in each of them (see Methods). The results of TDMPA for the WD\\(+\\)CC4 mouse model reveal multiple metabolic pathways that are significantly altered and scored highly (Fig. 2a). Most of the top-ranked pathways are related to lipid metabolism, especially fatty acids (beta-oxidation, biosynthesis, activation, desaturation, oxidation, metabolism), bile acids (biosynthesis and recycling), cholesterol (biosynthesis, metabolism, esterification),\n\nFig. 1: **Effect of WD \\(+\\) CC4 on mouse liver.****A** Microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin (HRE)-stained liver sections showing diffuse macro-vascular steatosis, lobular inflammation, and the presence of ballooned hepatocytes in the WD \\(+\\)CC4 group. **B** Histological scoring of the WD\\(+\\)CC4 group livers, given as median values.

Coil Red O staining comparing neutral lipid content of control and WD\\(+\\)CC4 group (unpaired \\(t\\)-test; phospholipids (biosynthesis and metabolism), TGs (biosynthesis), and the carnitine shuttle, as well as oxidative phosphorylation. We performed the same analysis for human MASH F1 vs. control (corresponding to dataset MASH vs. CTRL (2) in Table 1) and MASH progression (MASH F3 vs. MASLD) datasets (Fig. 2b, c, respectively). It is clear that the mouse model matches the human MASH vs. control results very well, but is less similar to MASH progression results. This becomes even more apparent when comparing the overlap of significantly altered pathways between the three datasets (Fig. 2d). We can discern a large overlap between altered metabolic pathways in mouse and human MASH, but the resemblance of altered metabolic pathways is less in human MASH progression compared to a mouse model. Out of the identified top-scored pathways, 54% of overall changes in metabolic pathways are similar in the human MASH and WD+CC4 mouse model. This is reduced to 11% when looking into MASLD to MASH progression. Specifically in terms of metabolic pathways, only five are commonly predicted as perturbed across all three datasets, namely fatty acid desaturation, and acylglycerides, estrogen, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism pathways. Between the mouse model and human MASH vs. control, 43 pathways are common, while 18 and 11 are only predicted in the mouse and human MASH vs. control datasets, respectively. The 43 common pathways include acyl-CoA hydrolysis, acylglycerides metabolism, bile acid biosynthesis and recycling, cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism, and esterification, glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, and\n\nFig. 2: **TDMPA results for the compared cases.****a** WJD+CC4 mouse model vs. Control, **b** human MASH vs. Control, **c** human MASH F3 vs. MASLD (MASH progression). **d** Corresponding Venn diagram of the statistically significant (FDR < 0.05) altered pathways across the three datasets.

The mouse-only pathways include chondro sulfate degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate/dicarboxylate metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism, and parts of the carnitine shuttle, fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation, oxidation, and beta-oxidation. Similarly, the human MASH vs. control-only pathways include nicotine and nicotinamide metabolism, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, ether lipid metabolism, heparan sulfate degradation, and various aminoacid metabolic pathways. The MASH progression dataset results in three metabolic pathways not predicted in neither mouse nor human MASH vs. control, namely glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto and neolacto series, blood group biosynthesis, and transport reactions.\n\nHaving identified the most relevant pathways, we then investigated the changes in the enzymatic reaction level (Fig. 3). Every participating reaction in the novo acylyllyceride biosynthesis, especially TG biosynthesis, was upregulated. TG degradation was also increased, especially in chylomicrons. Similarly, most reactions in glycerophospholipid biosynthesis were upregulated. In addition, cholesterol biosynthesis as well as the formation and hydrolysis of cholesterol esters were severely perturbed. These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting increased de novo biogenesis and accumulation of TGs in MASH\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and severely impacted cholesterol homeostasis\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\)\\({}^{\\circ}\\). Another part of the metabolic network that showed prominent changes in MASH was mitochondrial metabolism, specifically the\n\nFig. 3: **Metabolic network of the most affected pathways in mouse MASH model and corresponding reaction change ratios.** Green and red colors denote a calculated increase and decrease of reaction flux, respectively. Blue triangles denote a good agreement with corresponding human data (MASH vs. CTRL (2)). Reaction change ratios are reported as log2-fold-changes.

We observed that the carnitine shuttle shows increased activity in MASH in both binding and transporting fatty acids to the mitochondrial matrix. Subsequently, fatty acid beta-oxidation is quite affected. Finally, oxidative phosphorylation is disrupted in both the electron transport chain and ATP synthase parts. This is in agreement with multiple reports of mitochondrial dysregulation and oxidative stress playing a substantial part in MASH\\({}^{1940}\\).\n\nCompromised mitochondrial functions and bioenergetics in MASH lead to disruption of fatty acid beta-oxidation and oxidative stress\n\nAs we observed substantial alterations related to mitochondrial functions, we performed two functional assays focusing on mitochondrial bioenergetics and fatty acid oxidation in order to confirm our findings. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of MASH mice showed reduced complex1 and II-driven respiration as well as maximum respiration. Complex IV was the most affected in MASH livers as shown by its independent activity measurement using the artificial substrates (TMPD+ascorbate) (Fig. 4a). Since pyruvate is the terminal glycolysis product that enters mitochondria via the mitochondrial pyruvate complex (MPC), we examined whether the expression of MPC was affected in the MASH mouse liver. In the immunoblotting assessment, both subunits of MPC were downregulated in MASH mitochondria, indicating that not only the activity of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes was decreased significantly, but also pyruvate entry into mitochondria was lowered in MASH livers compared to control (Fig. 4b).\n\nWe additionally investigated whether fatty acid oxidation was affected in the MASH mouse livers. Respiratory provided a suitable tool to measure fatty acid oxidation since complete oxidation of a fatty acid ends in ATP generation and hence oxygen consumption via the ETC. Palinvolt-carnitine was used as a substrate whereas malate served as a counter ion. As expected, mitochondria isolated from the liver of MASH mice had lower fatty acid oxidation compared to control mitochondria (Fig. 4c). Fatty acid uptake into the mitochondria occurs via the carnitine shuttle. Carnitineine palmitvolttransferase (CPT1)-1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane binds carnitine to the fatty acids to enable entry into the intermembrane space. Subsequently, CPT-2, which is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, removes carnitine and leads the fatty acid to its oxidation in the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, we assessed whether the expression of CPT1s was affected in the MASH livers. Although the expression of CPT1a remained unchanged, CPT2 expression was reduced significantly in the MASH livers (Fig. 4d). It is interesting to note that while we confirmed a significant reduction in fatty acid beta-oxidation in the mitochondrial assay, TDMPA had predicted an increase of the pathway activity. This is due to the fact that TDMPA is a direct mapping of transcription-level changes and it does not always correspond to actual changes on the enzymatic and flux levels. However, the goal of TDMPA is to provide a first estimation of those changes and, most importantly, to direct our focus to the most affected metabolic pathways. In this respect, TDMPA correctly predicted major disruption in the mitochondrial metabolism during MASH. The occasional mismatch of the direction of change for each reaction can be attributed to cellular dynamics and molecular organization that cannot be captured solely\n\nFigure 4: **Effect of WD \\(+\\) CCI on (I) mitochondrial bioenergetics and (II) fatty acid oxidation.** A high-resolution respiratory of oxygen consumption (O2 flux) in mitochondria in liver homogenates of control vs. WD+CC4 group. **I** Immunoblot showing expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier MPC1 and MPC2 in liver homogenates.

We performed metabolic profiling within the targeted pathways and identified and quantified over 500 metabolites in mouse liver tissues (see Methods). In total, 252 metabolites were significantly different in the liver between control and MASH (Supplementary Data 1). Specifically, a large number of lipids were significantly different between the control and MASH groups (Fig. 5a, b). Acylarunites were decreased significantly in the MASH group compared to control. This is in agreement with the above-mentioned alterations in the mitochondrial beta-oxidation pathway and reduction in mitochondrial CPT2 expression. Conversely, a large number of TGs, diacylglycer correlates (DGs), monoacylglycer correlates (MGs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PEs), and cholesterol esters (CEs) were increased in MASH. Most bile acids (BAs) and lysophospholipids (LPLs) were also increased significantly in MASH. However, phosphatidylcholines (PCs) exhibited a mixed behavior. The most changes were observed in TGs, LPLs, phospholipids (PLs) (especially PEs), and acylaramines (Fig. 5b, c). Furthermore, we observed alterations of conjugated bile acids including taurondedeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), taurodeoxycholic acid-sulfate (TCDCA-S), tauroduc acid 3-sulfate (TCA-S), taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), and tauro-beta-muricholic acid (TMCA). The majority of the conjugated bile acids were significantly increased in MASH, which supports the TDMPA prediction of perturbed bile acid pathways (Fig. 2a).\n\nIn accordance with the changes of significant lipids in MASH, we further assessed the fatty acyl (FA) chain length composition in hepatic TGs, DGs, MGs, CEs, PLs, and LPLs (Fig. 6). The majority of altered esterified FAs in MASH were saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids such as FA 18:1, FA 16:0, and FA 16:1 (Fig. 6a). Specifically, oleic acid (FA 18:1) was increased in all detected lipid species. FA 20:3, FA 20:4, FA 22:4, and FA 22:5 within PLs were also increased significantly (Fig. 6b). These fatty acids are produced via desaturation and elongation of linoleic acid. These findings support the prediction of upregulated FA desaturation and FA elongation using the TDMPA approach.\n\n## ", "Discussion": "\n\nMASH is one of the most prevalent liver diseases worldwide. Despite several developments in animal models, an animal model that resembles the relevant pathophysiology and metabolism needs to be established to better identify targets for treatment and drug testing. Several mouse models of MASH and their histological characterizations have been studied. However, the extent to which their metabolic alterations resemble those in humans remains poorly described. Further evaluation is needed to assess the resemblance of metabolic alterations in animal models to human conditions.\n\nCurrently, developed mouse models include dietary, chemically, and genetically induced MASH models. HFD/WD-induced models exhibit the observed metabolic changes across the spectrum of MASH and MASH but might require many weeks of feeding to achieve the desired histopathology[21]. Chemical intoxication leads to fibrosis much faster; however, those models typically do not result in obesity, steatosis, and insulin resistance[13, 14]. Thus, these models are a good way to study\n\nFigure 5: ** Metabolic changes in MASH vs. healthy mouse liver tissue.****a** PCA plot, **b** volcano plot, **c** heatmap of the most changed lipids.

A combination of WD and hepatotoxins to induce fibrosis provides a good alternative for faster disease development while preserving the phenotype[7]. We hypothesized that this approach could lead to similar metabolic changes to human MASH, thus we used the already-established mouse model to test our hypothesis. In order to evaluate the resemblance of this model to human MASH regarding metabolic alterations, we developed TDMPA using genome-scale metabolic models and transcriptomics data and further confirmed our results using functional assays, lipidomics, and metabolomics analysis. Using TDMPA, we were able to map gene expression changes to metabolic reaction rate changes, and estimate the changes across the metabolic pathways. By evaluating the highest-scoring pathways, we defined the metabolic space where most changes occur in disease development and progression, obtaining valuable insights into the metabolic fingerprint of MASH.\n\nFigure 6: **Fatty acyl chain lengths of significantly altered lipids in MASH vs. healthy mouse liver tissue.** A Distribution per the direction of change and lipid class, **b** Box plots of log2-fold-changes per lipid class.

(MASH \\(n=17\\), control \\(n=9\\)).\n\n An essential aspect of metabolic pathway analysis is the ability to attain a certain level of granularity in the interpretation of the results, which is often lacking in gene expression analyses. We calculated the changes per metabolic reaction based on gene associations and then scored the metabolic pathways accordingly. TDMPA for the WD+CC4-induced MASH mouse model revealed that many aspects of lipid metabolism are severely affected, which can be grouped into roughly ten pathway families for further investigation. These include bile acid biosynthesis and recycling, fatty acid beta-oxidation, biosynthesis, and metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, metabolism, and esterification, leukotriene and arachidonic acid metabolism, carnitine shuttle, oxidative phosphorylation, phospholipid biosynthesis, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and the metabolism of multiple amino acids. We performed the same analysis for human MASH vs. control (Fig. 2b) and MASH progression (MASH F3 vs. MASLD) datasets (Fig. 2c). We observed that the mouse model resembles the human MASH results exceptionally well when compared to control (Fig. 2a vs. b), but the resemblance was less pronounced when compared to human MASH progression results (Fig. 2a vs. c). We can discern a large overlap between the mouse and human MASH vs. control pathways, but the human MASH progression pathways are quite different from both other cases. It is very important to define well the purpose of using animal models in investigating MASH development or progression. It is worth mentioning that the focus of this study was on metabolic alterations that resemble MASH in humans.\n\nSince we observed multiple changes in mitochondrial function, we performed two assays to evaluate the prediction. We confirmed that mitochondrial respiration and oxidation processes are disturbed in MASH mouse liver. These findings support previous hypotheses that mitochondria are heavily involved in the pathogenesis of MASHD, and could be a key player in its progression and regression\\({}^{\\text{\\text{\\textregistered}},\\text{\\textregistered}}\\). It is important to note that TDMPA predictions in terms of the direction of changes might not always reflect actual changes in the enzymatic and flux levels, since TDMPA is a direct mapping of transcription-level changes. Nevertheless, TDMPA's value lies in directing our focus to the most affected metabolic pathways and should be accompanied by enzymatic activity assessment and functional assays. Thus, TDMPA findings were further confirmed by lipidomics and metabolomics of the liver. More than 250 metabolites related to enzymatic reactions within the identified pathway families were significantly different in the MASH liver compared to the control. TGs were shown to be especially increased in MASH, thus further confirming the predicted increase of de novo acylglyceride biosynthesis. The increase of primary bile acids and conjugated bile acids has been reported in a previous study of MASH\\({}^{\\text{\\textregistered}}\\). Further assessment of the FA chain length composition in hepatic TG, DGAs, GCs, EEs, PIs, and LPIs showed an increase in saturated and monomustarted fatty acids such as FA 18:1, FA 16:0, and FA 16:1. Specifically, oleic acid (FA 18:1) was increased in all detected lipid species.\n\nThese results taken together shed light on metabolic pathways that are commonly changed in human and selected mouse models. Our comprehensive assessment provides additional evidence that WD +CC4-induced MASH is an appropriate mouse model for the study of human MASH pathophysiology and metabolism, confirming metabolic and functional resemblance. While TDMPA is limited by GEM annotation and exclusion of several metabolic processes such as signaling, it demonstratively offers an important level of granularity for the study of metabolic pathways in metabolic disorders and facilitates the direct mapping of changes on the gene expression level to metabolic reactions. Additionally, it is a valuable tool for defining metabolic space and better experimental design for lipidomics and metabolomics approaches in both animal models and humans. Finally, TDMPA can be used for the consistent comparison and evaluation of preclinical models, especially for targeting specific enzymes/ metabolic pathways. Accurate preclinical models and suitable methodologies to study them will enable and facilitate drug discovery and testing, identification of risk factors, development of better treatment strategies such as drug combination, and ultimately reduce the global burden of liver disease.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nRNA-seq data files from the present study have been deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession number GSE230639.

Recombinant human interleukin-2 (HL-2) has shown promise for treatment of autoimmune (AI) disorders yet exhibits short systemic half-life and opposing immune responses that negate an appropriate therapeutic index.\n\n**Methods** A semi-synthetic microbial technology platform was used to engineer a site-specifically regulated form of rhll-2 with enhanced PK, specificity for induction of immune-suppressive regulatory CD4 + T cells (Tregs), and reduced stimulation of off-target effector T and NK cells. A library of rhll-2 molecules was constructed with single site-specific, biorthogonal chemistry-compatible non-canonical amino acids installed near the interface where IL-2 engages its cognate receptor \\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\) (IL-2R\\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\)) signaling complex. Biorthogonal site-specific pegylation and functional screening identified variants that retained engagement of the IL-2R chain with attenuated potency at the IL-2R\\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\) complex.\n\n**Results** Phenotypic screening in mouse identifies SAR444336 (SAR44336; formerly known as THOR-809), rhll-2 pegylated at H16, as a potential development candidate that specifically expands peripheral CD4 + Tregs with upregulation of markers that correlate with their suppressive function including FoxP3, ICOS and Helios, yet minimally expands CD8 + T or NK cells. In non-human primate, administration of SAR'336 also induces dose-dependent expansion of Tregs and upregulated suppressive markers without significant expansion of CD8 + T or NK cells. SAR'336 administration reduces inflammation in a delayed-type hypersensitivity mouse model, potently suppressing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation.\n\n**Conclusion** SAR'336 is a specific Treg activator, supporting its further development for the treatment of Alu diseases.\n\n**Communications** medicine\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-024-00485-z**\n\nImmun homeostasis requires a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and suppressive immune responses, and imbalances often result in immunologic disease. Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis by restricting the activity of self-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, with their distinction associated with multiple autoimmune (AI) and inflammatory-related conditions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 52, 59, 70, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 99, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 19, 12, 14, 19, 15, 17, 19, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,responses in an investigational strategy aimed at resetting immune tolerance [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 8 \n\n### Generation of expression strains\n\nTo generate the azide-containing nAA, N6- (2-azidoethoxy)-carbonyl-L-lysine (AzK)-substituted IL-2 expression strains, an overnight culture of the parental strain SYTX169 was inoculated into 2xYT media containing 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 5 ug/mL tetracycline, and 50 mM potassium phosphate. The next day the culture was diluted and grown until an optical density of 0.4. The cells were then chilled on ice and centrifuged at 3000 x \\(g\\) for 10 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. The resulting cell pellet was washed twice using an equal volume of pre-chilled sterile deionized water and centrifuged. After the second wash, the cells were resuspended in fresh pre-chilled sterile deionized water and transformed via electroporation. After electroporation, pre-warmed 2xYTP with 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol was added to the electroporated cells and rescued at a final concentration of 150 uM dNaMTP and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C shaking at 250 rpm for an hour and inoculated into 2xYTP containing 5 ug/mL tetracycline, 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 50 ug/mL zeocin, 150 uM dNaMTP, and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP.\n\n### Preparation of pegylated IL-2 variants\n\nExpression of IL-2 variants with AzK substitutions was performed in 2xYT medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. BP9736) supplemented with 50 mM potassium phosphate, 100 ug/mL ampicillin, 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 50 ug/mL Zecoin, 150 uM dNaMTP, and 37.5 uM dTTP3TP. Expression cultures were incubated overnight at 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, and diluted prior to reaching OD600nm of 1 before dilution in the same medium back to OD600nm of 0.05. Upon reaching OD600nm of \\(\\sim\\)0.8, cultures were pre-induced with 250 uM NaMTP, 25 uM TP3TP, and 10 mM AzK-HCl prepared in deionized water (Synchron, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA; Cat No. 36462). Approximately 15 min after pre-induction, cultures were induced with 1 mM IPTG and incubated for an additional 5 h. Cultures were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, and pellets were stored at \\(-\\)80 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C until use.\n\nInclusion bodies were generated by addition of 50 mL lysis buffer (1x PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. BP2940-4) containing protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. A32965) and 1x lysozyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 89833). Resuspended pellets were lysed via microfluidizer (Dyrhydrodymatics, model M110L). Lysed samples were centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 25 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C before discarding the supernatant. Inclusion body pellets were solubilized by addition of 25 mL 6 M Guanidine-HCl in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH8, 20 mM imidazole per liter, pipetting until homogeneity before agitation for 15 min on a rotator. Samples were centrifuged at 30,000 x \\(g\\) for 20 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, and pellets were discarded.\n\nNi-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 25216) was pre-washed with solubilization/wash buffer (6 M Guanidine HCI, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM imidazole). Equilibrated resin was added to solubilized sample in conical tubes and incubated 1 h at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C on a rotator. Resin was collected by centrifugation for 2 min at 250 x g, and washed with 10-15 column volumes of solubilization/wash buffer, transferred to a collection column and washed for an additional 10 column volumes of solubilization/wash buffer. The column was eluted using 3 column volumes of elution buffer (1x solubilization/wash buffer containing 500 mM imidazole). Eluates were dialymed overnight in 12 l. of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8/150 mM NaCl, then moved to12 l. of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8/50 mM NaCl for an additional 4 h. The resulting dialysate was centrifuged at 30,000 x \\(g\\) for 20 min at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C and supernatant was collected.\n\nSamples were supplemented with 0.5 uI enterokinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, Cat. No. BP070I) per 10 ug of protein and incubated overnight at room temperature. To initiate pepylation, 5 mM DBCO-mPEG (Click Chemistry Tools, Scottsdale, AZ; 30 kDa Cat. No. A121, 10 kDa: Cat. No. A119, or 5 kDa: Cat. No. A118) stock was added to a final concentration of 50 uM, and incubated overnight at 4 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. Samples were concentrated using an Amicon-15 before loading onto HLiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg size-exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTA\\({}^{\\circ}\\) Pure system (GE Healthcare) in 1x PBS. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot using rabbit anti-IL-2 oligodend antibody (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No. 710146). Peak fractions were pooled and adjusted to a final concentration of 4.5% acetonitrile, 0.043% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were loaded onto a reversed phase chromatography column (GE Healthcare) in 4.5% acetonitrile/0.043% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted using a gradient of buffer B (90% acetonitrile/0.028% trifluoroacetic acid). Fractions of interest were pooled and mixed 1:1 with deionized H20, and lyophilized using a Laboconc Free/204.5 Lyophilized samples were then resuspended in 50% acetonitrile/0.1% FFA and quantitated using a bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve using biconthonic acid (BCA) method to determine final concentration prior to final lyophilization as above. Samples were stored lyophilized at \\(-\\)80 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C until use. Preparation of non-pegylated IL-2 and muteins was performed as above without pegylation steps described.\n\n### Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)\n\nThe SPR studies described herein were performed under contract by Biosensor Tools LLC (Salt Lake City, Utah, USA). The molecular mass of IL-2 samples was assumed to be 15 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)5 kDa, plus additional size of 30 kDa or 50 kDa PEG conjugation. 50-9 g samples were dissolved in 50 uI. water to make stock solutions of 64.5 uM. The Fc-tagged human IL-2 receptor subunits (extracellular domains) were purchased from Sino Biological (hIL-2 Ra-Fc Sino 10165-H02H, hIL-2 Rg-Fc Sino 10696-H02H). Recombinant human IL-2 (hill-2) was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Cat. No. PHC0021) and prepared at a stock concentration of 64.5 uM.\n\nUsing a Biacore 4000 optical biosensor, the Fc-IL-2 receptor subunits were immobilized to a protein A-coated C1 sensor chip to densities of \\(\\sim\\)300-800 RU and equilibrated with running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% Tween-20, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, pH 7.4). For additional higher density surface studies for human and compounds 8 per receptors, the receptors were captured to \\(\\sim\\)8000 and \\(\\sim\\)13,000 RU, respectively. Binding studies were performed at 25 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C. When necessary, the protein A surfaces were regenerated with 150 mM phosphoric acid between binding cycles. The test articles were tested in duplicate, in twofold dilution series from 0.7 to 200 nM. The responses from IL-2R surfaces were fit to a 1:1 interaction model to obtain binding parameters using Scrubber (v2.0c).\n\n### Flow cytometry assay for pSTATS induction\n\nPrimary human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) studies using flow cytometry were performed under contract by PrimityBio (Fremont, California, USA) or internally. The collection of blood samples from healthy donors was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The Scripps Research Institute (#177065). Leukocyte reduction systems (LRS) were purchased from Cell IDX (San Diego, California, USA). All donors provided informed consent. The studies were performed following the guidelines of the World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki.\n\nWhole blood samples were treated with compound and analyzed for pSTATS expression as previously described\". Briefly, blood samples were pre-warmed to 37 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, treated with a serial dilution of compound for 45 min, then red blood cells were lysed, and the leukocytes were stained with a panel of markers. Tregs are defined as CD3 \\(+\\) CD4\\(+\\) CD12ToD25\\(+\\) and CD8 T cells are CD3\\(+\\)CD8\\(+\\).\n\n### Quantitative analysis of IL-2 by ELISA\n\nBioanalysis of plasma samples was performed using a human IL-2 ELISA assay (Abcam, Cat. No. 10056). Concentrations of SAR336 in plasma and the internal standard were determined using the ELISA assay. Pharmacokine (PK) data analysis was performed at NW Solutions (Seattle, Washington, USA).\n\n### Animal models\n\nPurpose-bred cynomolgus monkeys (_Macaca fascicularis_) were sourced from licensed vendors and underwent standard quarantine periods prior to study initiation. Animal studies were conducted in AAAALAC-accredited facilities at Charles River Laboratories (Reno, NV) under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Two- to four-year-old male cynomolgus monkeys weighing 2-3 kg were used.\n\nAll animals and data points were included in the analysis, except in cases of poor sample quality such as dotted blood. Sample sizes were not statistically pre-determined. Single-dose PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) studies utilized \\(n=3\\)-\\(4\\) animals per group. Repeat dosing studies or studies dosing with antigen utilized \\(n=4\\)-\\(10\\) animals per group due to larger expected variability. In total, \\(265\\) mice and \\(48\\) monkeys were used. Samples/ animals in all experiments were randomized to each group. Animals were allocated to study groups at random by the vendor or assigned associate and did not control for confounders such as order of treatments. Studies included serial collections or individual animals per time point. Most studies report quantitative data measured without subjective scoring the exception was a qualitative blinded analysis by a pathologist to score ear inflammation. Vendors, investigators, and data analysts were not blinded during experiments.\n\n### Blood and tissue collection and processing for PK and immune cell profiling\n\nC57BL6 mice were housed at \\(72\\pm 5\\) \"F, ambient humidity, and \\(12\\) h lightdark cycle. Animal welfare for this study compiled with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Welfare Act (9 CFR Parts 1, 2 and 3) as applicable. All experimental data management and reporting procedures were in strict accordance with applicable Crown Bioscience, Inc or HD Biosciences Guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures.\n\nAfter a single intravenous injection of mice with H16, terminal blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture following CO\\({}_{2}\\) euthanasia. For the study of naive mice, blood was collected at \\(13\\) time points (\\(0.03\\), \\(0.17\\), \\(0.5\\), \\(1.2\\), \\(4\\), \\(8\\), \\(1.2\\), \\(24\\), \\(48\\), \\(72\\), \\(96\\), and \\(120\\) h) post-dose, sacrificing \\(3\\) mice per time point. Whole blood and plasma samples were analyzed for pSTAT5 expression across immune cell subsets and concentrations of IL-2 as previously described [37]. Alternatively, C57BL/6 mice were given a single dose of SAR'336 subcutaneously (SC) at \\(0.3\\) mg/kg. At \\(3\\)-, \\(8\\)-, and \\(14\\)-days post-dose, whole blood was collected from groups in K2 EDTA tubes followed by necroy and collection of spleen, thymus, and lymph node into cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with \\(5\\%\\) fetal bovine serum and then disaggregation by \\(70\\)-micron filter. Blood and spleen samples were pre-lysed with ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) buffer (Gibco). Blood and tissue cells were stained with antibodies against mouse CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, CD19, NK1.1, and forkhead box protein 3 (Fox93) cells to assess levels of Treg (CD4\\(+\\), CD25\\(+\\), Fox9\\(+\\)), CD4, CD8, and NK cells. Antibodies used in these studies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.\n\n### Flow cytometry of NHP whole blood samples\n\nBlood samples were serially collected to evaluate the effects of SAR'336 on immune cells with flow cytometry. Peripheral blood samples were treated for red blood cell lysis and fixed with Phosphow\" Lise/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences, NJ) immediately after collection. Cells were blocked with human TruStain FcX (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) before staining for cell surface markers.\n\nThe following surface markers were used to identify immune cell types: T cells (CD3\\(+\\) [BD Biosciences, clone S934-2], CD4\\(+\\) helper T cell (CD3\\(+\\)/CD4\\(+\\) [BioLegend, clone OKT4]), CD8 T cells (CD3\\(+\\)/CD8 [BD], clone SK1), CD4\\(+\\) Treg cells (CD3\\(+\\)/CD4\\(+\\)/CD25\\(+\\) [BioLegend, clone M-A251]/Fox9\\(+\\) [BioLegend, clone 259D]), and NK cells (CD3\\(-\\)/CD7\\(+\\) [BD, clone M-T701]). Cells were permeabilized and stained internally with anti-pSTAT5 (Y694) antibody (BD, clone 47/Stat5(pY694) and anti-Ki67 [Thermo Fisher, clone SolA15] antibodies. Samples were acquired on a BD Fotterosa flow cytometer. Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig 1.\n\n### DTI model\n\nC57BL/6 mice (\\(n=10\\) per treatment group) were sensitized SC with \\(250\\) ug keyhole limet hemocyanin (KLH) in PBS emulsified with equal parts of complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (\\(0.1\\) mL total volume) on day \\(1\\) and challenged with \\(10\\) ug KLH/\\(10\\) p PBS intradermally in ear pinnae on day \\(7\\). Ear thickness was measured prior to KLH challenge on day \\(7\\) and daily until day \\(10\\). Groups were dosed SC \\(10\\) mL/kg on day \\(0\\) and \\(3\\) with SAR'336 at \\(0.03\\), \\(0.1\\), and \\(0.3\\) mg/kg with a vehicle control (\\(10\\) mM histidine, \\(5\\%\\) sorbitol, \\(0.01\\%\\) polygorbate \\(80\\)). A group was treated with cyclospor A on days \\(0\\)-\\(9\\) at \\(60\\) mg/kg by oral gavage (\\(10\\) mL/kg in \\(0.5\\%\\) methyl cellulose). Another vehicle control group received day \\(7\\) KLH challenge without day \\(1\\) sensitization. Ear thickness of the ear flap was measured in millimeters using an engineering micrometer prior to KLH challenge on day \\(7\\) and then subsequently on days \\(8\\)-\\(10\\). The animals were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation.\n\nWhole blood from half of the treatment group was serially collected in K2 EDTA tubes at baseline and on day \\(7\\) via jugular venipuncture, and blood from the other half of the treatment group was collected on days \\(3\\) and \\(10\\). Staining antibodies for cell surface markers were added to \\(50\\) uL Brilliant Violet Buffer Plus (BD cat no. \\(566349\\)) to make a master staining mix. Whole blood was incubated for \\(30\\) min in the dark at room temperature. After incubation, \\(1\\) xerthroyles solution (Serotec BUP04) was added to samples, mixed, and incubated for \\(10\\) min at room temperature.

PBMC were washed twice and filtered through a 70 uM filter prior to sorting on a BD FACSAria II Cell Server S10 RB27366. Live cells were defined as propidium iodide negative. CD8 T cells were defined as CD3 + CD56-CD8+ and Tregs as CD3 + CD56-CD4 + CD127-CD25+. CD8 T cells were then labeled with Cell Trace Violet (ThermoFisherFisher), following manufacturer's guidelines. CDs T cells and Tregs were combined at the indicated ratios and cultured in complete RPMI (RPMI + 10% FBS+1% penicillin/streptomycin) with nHL-2 (Gibco Cat. No. PHC0023 or Cat.

Our previous studies employed the same semi-synthetic genetic code technology used in the current work to generate IL-2 variants intended for immuno-oncology indications with targeted PEG modifications on IL-2 at its interface with the IL-2Ra subunit of the receptor to block IL-2Ra engagement. This work led to the identification of SAR444245 (THOR-707) as a potent and specific activator of the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) complex [9]. For AI diseases, we hypothesized that similar replacement of IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb or \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces of IL-2 with nAs allowed by pegylation of these sites could produce a modified IL-2 with the reverse pharmacologic specificity. namely, a half-life extended pegylated IL-2 compound with reduced IL-2R\\(\\gamma\\) interactions that requires IL-2Ra engagement for signaling (Fig. 1).\n\nTo identify residues that, when pegylated, specifically modulate the potency of IL-2 for the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) complex, we selected 16 IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces for production and functional analysis. Some of these amino acid sites, including V91, N88, and H16, were previously described [13, 14, 15]. IL-2 variants with the AzK substitutions in the designed residues were expressed as inclusion bodies in the _E coli_-based semi-synthetic organism, purified, and refolded (for full details, see ref. [9]). The refold AzK-modified IL-2 variants were then site specifically and covalently pegylated at the AzK residue using click chemistry via dibenzocyclodoctype (DBCO)-functionalized PEG molecules.\n\nThe resulting compounds were screened for differential receptor specificity and potency in primary immune cell subpopulations using multicolor flow cytometry and compared to previously described muteins and pegylated benchmarks (Supplementary Table 2). Potency was measured in fresh PBMC samples treated with either nHL-2, mutein, or pegylated IL-2 variants. After incubation for 45 min, samples were stained with antibodies to detect the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT5 (pSTAT5), a receptor-proximal marker of IL-2 receptor signaling, and a panel of surface markers to follow signaling and activation in specific lymphocyte subpopulations.\n\nThe results of the ex vivo profiling identified pegylated IL-2 compounds with a large range of potencies for Treg, CD8 + T, and NK cells (Supplementary Table 2). All pegylated variants showed measurable reduction in potency compared to the unmodified nHL-2 compound, consistent with previous, attachment site independent and non-specific reduction in potency mediated by attached PEG [9]. On Tregs, the target cell population, pegylated variants showed a distribution of potencies that ranged from 2 to 15,000-fold reduction relative to native recombinant IL-2 protein (Supplementary Table 2). Compared to Treg potency, each variant showed similar or enhanced reductions in potency for the off-target CD8 + T and NK cell populations (Supplementary Table 2), which express little to no IL-2Ra. These results confirm that PEG modification of IL-2 near the IL-2R8 and \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces can modulate the potency of these compounds for stimulating different cell types, suggesting that the PEG modification may affect differences in receptor binding or assembly kinetics.\n\nIn vivo screening of candidate compounds identified H16 as a pegylation site for selective stimulation of Tregs with minimal effects on CD8 + T and NK cells\n\nWhile ex vivo profiling of pegylated IL-2 compounds identified molecules that exhibited a large range of potencies on target Treg cells, these data did not allow assessment of how potency differences translate to in vivo pharmacologic activity. To elucidate the potential interplay between ex vivo potency and in vivo PK and PD effects, we performed an in vivo screen comparing the capacity of each compound to specifically target Treg populations in mice. After a single intravenous dose (0.9 mg/kg) of each compound administered to C57B/L6 mice, peripheral blood samples were collected. Comparison of maximal Treg expansion revealed that IL-2 with residue H16 replaced with AzK and pegylated with a 30 kDaPEG exhibited the highest change in peripheral Treg frequency (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, Q126 did not alter the frequency in peripheral Tregs (Fig. 2a) despite having similar potency to H16 in vitro (Supplementary Table 2). These results indicate that in vitro potency is not a good indicator of Treg expansion, as measured by frequency of all cells. The percentage of Treg, CD8 T cells, and NK cells present in peripheral blood cells after treatment with H16 or N88R/D109 is plotted as a function of time post-dose in Fig. 2c. While H16 or N88R/D109 promoted strong expansion of Tregs in the periphery, minimal to low expansion of CD8 T cells or NK cells was observed with H16 treatment (Fig. 2c). In contrast, Fc-IL-2 and pegylated IL-2 molecules at S127, V91, T123, and K9 promoted similar fold-change expansion in frequency of peripheral Tregs and NK cells. Since this analysis focuses on cells within the periphery, it could exclude any potential differences that may exist in recruitment of immune cells into tissue by these variants.\n\nComparison of PK profiles of each candidate compound demonstrated that H16 exhibited an extended half-life with exposure among the longest in the set of compounds screened (Supplementary Fig. 2), followed by Q126. Interestingly, compounds of higher potencies for Tregs and other cell types, including the IL-2 molecule pegylated at residue L19, generally showed faster clearance rates and lower exposure compared to compounds of lower potency, including H16 (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nH16 induces expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation, and suppressive function in mice\n\nAs H16 demonstrated a superior Treg expansion and PK profile, we examined whether administration of this compound stimulated differential expression of markers that correlate with Treg function. Post-administration serial peripheral blood samples drawn from C57BL/6 mice described above were analyzed using flow cytometry for expression of markers that correlate with Treg activation and differentiation, including IL-2Ra (Fig. 3a), Foxp23 (Fig. 3b), Helios and ICOS, proteins known to be critical for Treg identity and suppressive function, as well as the proliferation marker Ki 67 (Fig. 3c-e). After H16 administration, the intensity of functional marker expression began increasing starting approximately one daypost-dose, and expression levels peaked between day 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). CD25, FovP3 and Kic7 signals were substantially increased over pre-dose levels, showing a 4- to 5-fold increased expression at their peak and decreased to near baseline levels by day 4 post-dose (Fig. 3a, b, and e). Signals for ICOS and Helios showed similar magnitudes of induction, with an approximately 3- to 4-fold increase over peak levels at day 2-3, albeit with a prolonged maintenance of expression levels and gradually decreasing levels to baseline after approximately 7 days (Fig. 3c, d). Together, these results show that H16 administration in mice drives Treg activation and upregulation of markers associated with proliferation and suppressive capacity.\n\nH16 drives dose-dependent Treg expansion and expression of markers of differentiation and suppressive function in non-human primate (NHP)\n\nTo study the effect of dose level on peripheral exposure and PD, increasing doses of H16 were administered to cynomolgus monkeys and peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that, at increasing dose, the exposure increased proportionally (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and CD4\\(+\\) Tregs as a percentage of peripheral blood cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3b) or as a percentage of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3c) showed large increases the\n\nFig. 1: **Overview of IL-2 related Treg biology and therapeutic hypothesis of an IL-2Ra biased IL-2 for Treg expansion and activation.****a** Normal Treg biology showing opposing pleiotropic effects of IL-2. **b** Schematic representation of an IL-2Ra biased IL-2 for therapeutic expansion and activation of Treg cells and induction of immune suppressive effects along with reduced stimulation of CD8 + T and NK cells.

At the highest dose evaluated (0.67 mg/kg), Treg frequency peaked at approximately 20% of whole blood and 60% of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a). Increased frequency of CD4 Tregs (Fig. 4a) correlated with an increase in total cells in the circulation (Fig. 4b). Minimal expansion of CD8 + T and NK (Fig. 4b) populations was observed at doses of H16 that drove substantial expansion of Treg populations. Similarly to mouse, administration of H16 promoted Treg upregulation in the intensity of CD25, Fox23, Helios, and pSTATS (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 3d), which correlate with differentiation and Treg suppressive function, and increased levels of circulating soluble CD25 were observed (Supplementary Fig. 3e), which peaked 96-120 h post-dosing.\n\n### H16 extension of peripheral half-life and activation of Tregs in NHP is modulated by PEG length\n\nTo test the effect of PEG length on H16 pharmacology, H16 was conjugated to either a 30 kDa or 50 kDa linear mPEG. In vitro, H16 conjugation to a larger size PEG polymer (50 kDa versus 30 kDa) resulted in a modest reduction in potency ex vivo (Fig. 5a). When administered to NHPs, PEG50 conjugates of H16 showed significantly extended half-life (Fig. 5b) and exposure measured as area under the curve (Table 1), promoting a surprisingly greater peripheral Treg expansion compared to 30 kDa predicted H16 (Fig. 5c). Thus, all further studies in the NHP model were conducted using the H16 variant biocomiquated with PEG 50 kDa, hereafter referred to as the clinical candidate SAR336.\n\nFigure 2: **Compound screening in mice identified SAR\u2019336, an IL-2 variant pegylated at residue H16, which significantly expanded large populations compared to other compounds. A single subcutaneous dose (-0.9 mg/kg) of the indicated variant was administered to C5/BL/8 mice. Flow cytometry was used to quantitate Treg (CD4 + CD25+ Fox23 +), CD8 T and NK cell expansion in peripheral blood.

Similarly to H16 bioconjugated to a 30 kD PEG (Fig. 4b), SAR'336 promoted Treg expansion with minimal changes in CD\\(8+\\) or NK cell frequencies. Quantification of the induction of biomarkers for activation and proliferation in peripheral blood revealed robust induction of pSTAT5, Kit-67, and CD25. Similarly, levels of FoxP3 and Helios, markers that correlate with differentiation and suppressive function of Tregs in peripheral blood, were also increased (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nSAR'336 engages IL-2R\\(\\alpha\\) with high affinity, but does not measurably interact with IL-2R\\(\\beta\\)\n\nAs the pegylation site in SAR'336 replaces a residue that makes direct contact with the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit at the IL-2/IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) interface, we hypothesized that this modification may cause differential binding kinetics to the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit. To understand the mechanism by which SAR'336 demonstrates a bias for stimulation of Treg proliferation and activation over CD\\(8+\\) and NK cells in NHP, we used SPR to directly measure binding. The extracellular portions of the human IL-2R\\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) were immobilized on the surface of SPR sensor chips, and concentration series of rhll-2 or SAR336 were applied to these surfaces. Binding to the\n\nFig. 3: **H16 administration stimulates increased Treg expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation and suppressive function.** H16 (0.9 mg/ kg) was administered via tail vein injection to C57BL/6 mice, and peripheral blood was recovered at intervals post dose.

The expression of CD25 (**a**), FoxP3 (**b**), Helios (**c**), ICOS receptors was monitored as the change in response units as a function of time during association and dissociation (wash) phases. On IL-2Ra surfaces, rhll-2 showed high affinity binding characterized by rapid association and slow dissociation kinetics (Fig. 6a, **upper left panel**, Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, SAR'336 interacted with high affinity with the IL-2Ra surface, with an approximately 3-fold reduction in affinity as expected for non-specific PEG effects on binding (Fig. 6a, **upper right panel**, Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, surfaces containing immobilized IL-2 RB showed robust association and dissociation responses with rhll-2 (Fig. 6a, **lower left panel**), while SAR'336 did not measurably engage the IL-2R subunit surface, even at high concentrations (Fig. 6a, **lower right panel**). These results suggest that SAR'336 retains interaction with the IL-2Ra subunit but lacks any measurable affinity to the IL-2RB subunit.\n\n### SAR'336 specifically activates pSTAT5 expression in Tregs but not CD8 + T cells ex vivo\n\nTo determine how the reduced IL-2R$ affinity of SAR'336 affects activation of primary human immune cell subpopulations, we profiled the effect of this engineered cytokine on lymphocyte activation in human PBMC samples. In Treg populations, rhll-2 showed potential stimulation of pSTAT5 formation compared to SAR'336 (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that a slight reduction in IL-2Ra affinity and absence of IL-2RB engagement may significantly affect SAR'336 signaling compared to rhll-2. In CD8 + T and NK cell populations, SAR'336 was not observed to stimulate pSTAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 6b), unlike rhll-2. With rhll-2, potency in NK cells is 120 - 250-fold less than that observed in Tregs. However, a similar ratio of pSTAT5 induction in NK cells and CD8 T cells was not observed with SAR'336, suggesting that SAR'336 may\n\nFig. 4: **Hi6 induces dose-dependent, large-scale Treg expansion and expression of biomarkers of differentiation and suppressive function in NHP.****a**, **b** H16 administration to NHP drives Treg expansion in a dose-dependent manner.

Taken together, these results suggest that SAR336 is strongly reduced for signaling potency at the IL-2 R\\(\\beta\\)F complex, but that this reduction in potency seems to be overcome by binding to the IL-2Ra subunit that is highly expressed on Tregs.\n\n### SAR'336 treatment reduces inflammation in mouse DTH model\n\nTo confirm that the PD and pharmacological effects of SAR336 administration were not limited to the periphery, C57BL/6 mice were administered either the vehicle or SAR336 (0.3 mg/kg, SC administration) and peripheral blood samples and lymphoid organs were collected on days 0 (baseline) and 3-, 8-, and 14-days post-treatment (Fig. 7a). SAR336 induced higher frequencies of Treg cells in blood as well as secondary lymphoid organs compared to vehicle (Fig. 7b). After a single dose, 5-11% of cells in the circulation, lymph node, and spleen were CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, which translates to a synchronized 5- to 15-fold increase in the percentage of Tregs after 3 days, and a lower increase in Treg frequency in the thymus peaking on day 8 (Fig. 7b). In a mouse ear model of KLH-induced DTH, repeat dosing of SAR336 induced dose-dependent increase in Treg frequency that peaked on day 3, the day of the second repeat dose, and remained elevated 10 days after the first dose (Fig. 8a). At 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg dose, SAR336-significantly suppressed the amount of ear swelling (Fig. 8a) as well as decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into ear tissue (Fig. 8b) at 0.3 mg/kg dose, following re-challenge with KLH.\n\n \n\n**Tregs treated with SAR'336 are potent suppressors of CD4\\(+\\) and CD8\\(+\\) T cell proliferation ex vivo**\n\nAs SAR'336 administration in mice stimulated the large-scale expansion of Treg populations, upregulation of markers that correlate with activity, and in vivo suppression of the DTH response, we hypothesized that the SAR'336-treated Treg populations have enhanced suppressive capacity compared to Tregs from naive animals. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with either vehicle or SAR'336, then splenocytes populations were collected at 2 days post-dose, harvesting CD4\\(+\\) Treg cells from SAR'336-treated and vehicle-treated animals.

These results suggest that SAR'336 effectively induces Tregs that have a significantly higher functional suppressive capacity.\n\n## Discussion\n\nWhile study of the human cytokine IL-2 has been an area of intense focus in therapeutic development, efforts to utilize IL-2 and other cytokines for the treatment of immunologic disease has been challenging due to complex and pleiotropic signaling effects. In the case of IL-2, this cytokine displays dual functionality via both induction of immune responses through stimulation of proliferation of effector T (Teff) and NK cells, and control of immune responses through maintenance of Treg cells [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, N88 that modulate IL-2 potency to the IL-2 receptor beta subunit[31, 32, 33], our pegylation strategy enabled significantly differentiated properties to be identified in vitro and in vivo. The first step in this process was identification of residues that, when pegylated with a 30 kDa PEG modification, adjusted the cell-specific activity and potency of the resulting molecule. When the H16 variant of IL-2 was conjugated with a 50 kDa linear PEG, the larger conjugate was modestly reduced in potency (approx. twofold reduction in EC\\({}_{50\\text{s}}\\) the half-maximal effective concentration) relative to a 30 kDa PEG, as determined by pSTATS activation in Treg cells. However, a single SC dose of H16 with a 50 kDa PEG administered to cynomolus monkeys unexpectedly produced a much larger exposure relative to the 30 kDa PEG bio-conjugate (3.4X). SAR336 with a 50 kDa PEG also induced a larger and more persistent expansion of peripheral Treg cells in NHP relative to the 30 kDa PEG bioconjugate. We conclude that peripheral Treg expansion in response to SAR336 is exposure-driven, with the size the of PEG bioconjugate likely limiting renal filtration and improving both compound exposure and levels of Treg expansion.\n\nOur data show that SAR336 interactions with the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit are too weak to be measured using SPR. However, the current models for IL-2 receptor signaling suggest that recruitment of the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit is required for signaling[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 Teff and NK cells and these have shown remarkable Treg selectivity [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. However, typical residues targeted by such muting occupy regions of the IL-2 protein that are enriched for P1 anchor sequences that allow peptide presentation on class II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Indeed, initial variants that utilize these sites have generated anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation in human clinical trials, and we speculate that this may be a limitation of both the method and of the IL-2 variants that rely on this regional modification. While ADAs may limit the efficacy of a drug over time, muting that drive potential anti-drug immune responses may further lead to epitope spreading and neutralization of the patient's native protein [34, 35, 36], further limiting the use of these methods. In contrast, the mutien-generating approach presented here utilizes chemically stable covalent PEG modification, which may avoid involvement of steps in the class II MHC presentation pathway and limit subsequent immunogenicity and ADA formation, resulting in an overall safer therapeutic agent. The lack of ADA formation in clinical studies of the SAR44245 molecule further supports this contention [34].\n\nRecently, Zhang et al. [35] presented evidence of improved PK and immunosuppression by an engineered IL-2 molecule in mouse models of AI diseases by orthogonally conjugating with PEG via copper-free click reaction through incorporation of azide-containing amino acids using a canonical amber suppression method to incorporate \\(\\text{A}\\text{z}\\text{x}^{\\phi}\\). Unlike SAR336, which contains a 50 kDa PEG at site H16, these authors utilized 20 kDa PEG conjugations at Y31 and T51 to achieve their desired phenotype. Using a different approach, NKTR-358 conjugated native rhll-2 protein with PEG moieties using standard chemical coupling methodologies [36]. In a single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 demonstrated a dose-dependent expansion of proliferating CD25\\(+\\) Treg cells. No measurable changes in the numbers and percentages of CD4\\(+\\) and CD8\\(+\\) T cells were seen, but low-level increases in NK cell numbers were observed at the highest doses tested [35]. Interestingly, the NKTR-358 compound has been reported to feature significant reductions in IL-2Ra, as well as IL-2Ra engagement, a substantial functional difference from SAR336. We speculate that these differences may arise due to the non-specific population chemistry used to generate the NKTR-358 molecule, which may target residues with undesired pharmacological consequences. Additional studies will be required to determine the differential and comparative pharmacology observed for these compounds compared to SAR336.\n\nIn the widening field of cytokine therapies for AI disorders, precision engineering of biologists will enable increased specificity and reduced off-target pleiotropy to be designed into natural immune regulatory cytokines. The application of the semi-synthetic genetic code technology to introduce site-specific and orthogonal chemistry via novel amino acids to achieve targeted bioconjugation of moieties led to the identification and design of SAR336, an improved, regulated IL-2 with enhanced PK and a more specific target binding profile. The concepts and strategies utilized here to\n\nFig. 9: **Tregs treated with SAR\u2019336 are potent suppressors of CD8 \\(+\\) T cell proliferation ex vivo. a Schematic of the experiment to measure ex vivo suppressive capacity of Treg: mice were administered either vehicle or SAR\u2019336 (0.3 mg/kg), and splenocytes populations were collected at 2 days post-dose.

Together, the findings presented here demonstrate that SAR'336 is a specific activator of Treg proliferation and suppressive function, with minimal expansion of Tefs and NK cells populations. These results from mouse and NHP models support the continued development of SAR'336 as a clinical development candidate for treatment of AI-related disorders.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the studies reported herein are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Recombinant human interleukin-2 (HL-2) has shown promise for treatment of autoimmune (AI) disorders yet exhibits short systemic half-life and opposing immune responses that negate an appropriate therapeutic index.\n\n**Methods** A semi-synthetic microbial technology platform was used to engineer a site-specifically regulated form of rhll-2 with enhanced PK, specificity for induction of immune-suppressive regulatory CD4 + T cells (Tregs), and reduced stimulation of off-target effector T and NK cells. A library of rhll-2 molecules was constructed with single site-specific, biorthogonal chemistry-compatible non-canonical amino acids installed near the interface where IL-2 engages its cognate receptor \\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\) (IL-2R\\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\)) signaling complex. Biorthogonal site-specific pegylation and functional screening identified variants that retained engagement of the IL-2R chain with attenuated potency at the IL-2R\\(\\beta_{\\text{T}}\\) complex.\n\n**Results** Phenotypic screening in mouse identifies SAR444336 (SAR44336; formerly known as THOR-809), rhll-2 pegylated at H16, as a potential development candidate that specifically expands peripheral CD4 + Tregs with upregulation of markers that correlate with their suppressive function including FoxP3, ICOS and Helios, yet minimally expands CD8 + T or NK cells. In non-human primate, administration of SAR'336 also induces dose-dependent expansion of Tregs and upregulated suppressive markers without significant expansion of CD8 + T or NK cells. SAR'336 administration reduces inflammation in a delayed-type hypersensitivity mouse model, potently suppressing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proliferation.\n\n**Conclusion** SAR'336 is a specific Treg activator, supporting its further development for the treatment of Alu diseases.\n\n**Communications** medicine\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-024-00485-z**\n\nImmun homeostasis requires a delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and suppressive immune responses, and imbalances often result in immunologic disease. Cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a key role in maintaining immune homeostasis by restricting the activity of self-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells, with their distinction associated with multiple autoimmune (AI) and inflammatory-related conditions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 52, 59, 70, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 99, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 19, 12, 14, 19, 15, 17, 19, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,responses in an investigational strategy aimed at resetting immune tolerance [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 8 \n\n### ", "Generation of expression strains": "\n\nTo generate the azide-containing nAA, N6- (2-azidoethoxy)-carbonyl-L-lysine (AzK)-substituted IL-2 expression strains, an overnight culture of the parental strain SYTX169 was inoculated into 2xYT media containing 5 ug/mL chloramphenicol, 5 ug/mL tetracycline, and 50 mM potassium phosphate.

Our previous studies employed the same semi-synthetic genetic code technology used in the current work to generate IL-2 variants intended for immuno-oncology indications with targeted PEG modifications on IL-2 at its interface with the IL-2Ra subunit of the receptor to block IL-2Ra engagement. This work led to the identification of SAR444245 (THOR-707) as a potent and specific activator of the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) complex [9]. For AI diseases, we hypothesized that similar replacement of IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb or \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces of IL-2 with nAs allowed by pegylation of these sites could produce a modified IL-2 with the reverse pharmacologic specificity. namely, a half-life extended pegylated IL-2 compound with reduced IL-2R\\(\\gamma\\) interactions that requires IL-2Ra engagement for signaling (Fig. 1).\n\nTo identify residues that, when pegylated, specifically modulate the potency of IL-2 for the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) complex, we selected 16 IL-2 residues in or near the IL-2Rb\\(\\gamma\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces for production and functional analysis. Some of these amino acid sites, including V91, N88, and H16, were previously described [13, 14, 15]. IL-2 variants with the AzK substitutions in the designed residues were expressed as inclusion bodies in the _E coli_-based semi-synthetic organism, purified, and refolded (for full details, see ref. [9]). The refold AzK-modified IL-2 variants were then site specifically and covalently pegylated at the AzK residue using click chemistry via dibenzocyclodoctype (DBCO)-functionalized PEG molecules.\n\nThe resulting compounds were screened for differential receptor specificity and potency in primary immune cell subpopulations using multicolor flow cytometry and compared to previously described muteins and pegylated benchmarks (Supplementary Table 2). Potency was measured in fresh PBMC samples treated with either nHL-2, mutein, or pegylated IL-2 variants. After incubation for 45 min, samples were stained with antibodies to detect the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT5 (pSTAT5), a receptor-proximal marker of IL-2 receptor signaling, and a panel of surface markers to follow signaling and activation in specific lymphocyte subpopulations.\n\nThe results of the ex vivo profiling identified pegylated IL-2 compounds with a large range of potencies for Treg, CD8 + T, and NK cells (Supplementary Table 2). All pegylated variants showed measurable reduction in potency compared to the unmodified nHL-2 compound, consistent with previous, attachment site independent and non-specific reduction in potency mediated by attached PEG [9]. On Tregs, the target cell population, pegylated variants showed a distribution of potencies that ranged from 2 to 15,000-fold reduction relative to native recombinant IL-2 protein (Supplementary Table 2). Compared to Treg potency, each variant showed similar or enhanced reductions in potency for the off-target CD8 + T and NK cell populations (Supplementary Table 2), which express little to no IL-2Ra. These results confirm that PEG modification of IL-2 near the IL-2R8 and \\(\\gamma\\) interfaces can modulate the potency of these compounds for stimulating different cell types, suggesting that the PEG modification may affect differences in receptor binding or assembly kinetics.\n\nIn vivo screening of candidate compounds identified H16 as a pegylation site for selective stimulation of Tregs with minimal effects on CD8 + T and NK cells\n\nWhile ex vivo profiling of pegylated IL-2 compounds identified molecules that exhibited a large range of potencies on target Treg cells, these data did not allow assessment of how potency differences translate to in vivo pharmacologic activity. To elucidate the potential interplay between ex vivo potency and in vivo PK and PD effects, we performed an in vivo screen comparing the capacity of each compound to specifically target Treg populations in mice. After a single intravenous dose (0.9 mg/kg) of each compound administered to C57B/L6 mice, peripheral blood samples were collected. Comparison of maximal Treg expansion revealed that IL-2 with residue H16 replaced with AzK and pegylated with a 30 kDaPEG exhibited the highest change in peripheral Treg frequency (Fig. 2a, b). In contrast, Q126 did not alter the frequency in peripheral Tregs (Fig. 2a) despite having similar potency to H16 in vitro (Supplementary Table 2). These results indicate that in vitro potency is not a good indicator of Treg expansion, as measured by frequency of all cells. The percentage of Treg, CD8 T cells, and NK cells present in peripheral blood cells after treatment with H16 or N88R/D109 is plotted as a function of time post-dose in Fig. 2c. While H16 or N88R/D109 promoted strong expansion of Tregs in the periphery, minimal to low expansion of CD8 T cells or NK cells was observed with H16 treatment (Fig. 2c). In contrast, Fc-IL-2 and pegylated IL-2 molecules at S127, V91, T123, and K9 promoted similar fold-change expansion in frequency of peripheral Tregs and NK cells. Since this analysis focuses on cells within the periphery, it could exclude any potential differences that may exist in recruitment of immune cells into tissue by these variants.\n\nComparison of PK profiles of each candidate compound demonstrated that H16 exhibited an extended half-life with exposure among the longest in the set of compounds screened (Supplementary Fig. 2), followed by Q126. Interestingly, compounds of higher potencies for Tregs and other cell types, including the IL-2 molecule pegylated at residue L19, generally showed faster clearance rates and lower exposure compared to compounds of lower potency, including H16 (Supplementary Table 2).\n\nH16 induces expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation, and suppressive function in mice\n\nAs H16 demonstrated a superior Treg expansion and PK profile, we examined whether administration of this compound stimulated differential expression of markers that correlate with Treg function. Post-administration serial peripheral blood samples drawn from C57BL/6 mice described above were analyzed using flow cytometry for expression of markers that correlate with Treg activation and differentiation, including IL-2Ra (Fig. 3a), Foxp23 (Fig. 3b), Helios and ICOS, proteins known to be critical for Treg identity and suppressive function, as well as the proliferation marker Ki 67 (Fig. 3c-e). After H16 administration, the intensity of functional marker expression began increasing starting approximately one daypost-dose, and expression levels peaked between day 2 and 3 (Fig. 3). CD25, FovP3 and Kic7 signals were substantially increased over pre-dose levels, showing a 4- to 5-fold increased expression at their peak and decreased to near baseline levels by day 4 post-dose (Fig. 3a, b, and e). Signals for ICOS and Helios showed similar magnitudes of induction, with an approximately 3- to 4-fold increase over peak levels at day 2-3, albeit with a prolonged maintenance of expression levels and gradually decreasing levels to baseline after approximately 7 days (Fig. 3c, d). Together, these results show that H16 administration in mice drives Treg activation and upregulation of markers associated with proliferation and suppressive capacity.\n\nH16 drives dose-dependent Treg expansion and expression of markers of differentiation and suppressive function in non-human primate (NHP)\n\nTo study the effect of dose level on peripheral exposure and PD, increasing doses of H16 were administered to cynomolgus monkeys and peripheral blood samples were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that, at increasing dose, the exposure increased proportionally (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and CD4\\(+\\) Tregs as a percentage of peripheral blood cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3b) or as a percentage of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 3c) showed large increases the\n\nFig. 1: **Overview of IL-2 related Treg biology and therapeutic hypothesis of an IL-2Ra biased IL-2 for Treg expansion and activation.****a** Normal Treg biology showing opposing pleiotropic effects of IL-2. **b** Schematic representation of an IL-2Ra biased IL-2 for therapeutic expansion and activation of Treg cells and induction of immune suppressive effects along with reduced stimulation of CD8 + T and NK cells.

At the highest dose evaluated (0.67 mg/kg), Treg frequency peaked at approximately 20% of whole blood and 60% of CD4 T cells (Fig. 4a). Increased frequency of CD4 Tregs (Fig. 4a) correlated with an increase in total cells in the circulation (Fig. 4b). Minimal expansion of CD8 + T and NK (Fig. 4b) populations was observed at doses of H16 that drove substantial expansion of Treg populations. Similarly to mouse, administration of H16 promoted Treg upregulation in the intensity of CD25, Fox23, Helios, and pSTATS (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 3d), which correlate with differentiation and Treg suppressive function, and increased levels of circulating soluble CD25 were observed (Supplementary Fig. 3e), which peaked 96-120 h post-dosing.\n\n### ", "H16 extension of peripheral half-life and activation of Tregs in NHP is modulated by PEG length": "\n\nTo test the effect of PEG length on H16 pharmacology, H16 was conjugated to either a 30 kDa or 50 kDa linear mPEG. In vitro, H16 conjugation to a larger size PEG polymer (50 kDa versus 30 kDa) resulted in a modest reduction in potency ex vivo (Fig. 5a). When administered to NHPs, PEG50 conjugates of H16 showed significantly extended half-life (Fig. 5b) and exposure measured as area under the curve (Table 1), promoting a surprisingly greater peripheral Treg expansion compared to 30 kDa predicted H16 (Fig. 5c). Thus, all further studies in the NHP model were conducted using the H16 variant biocomiquated with PEG 50 kDa, hereafter referred to as the clinical candidate SAR336.\n\nFigure 2: **Compound screening in mice identified SAR\u2019336, an IL-2 variant pegylated at residue H16, which significantly expanded large populations compared to other compounds. A single subcutaneous dose (-0.9 mg/kg) of the indicated variant was administered to C5/BL/8 mice.

Similarly to H16 bioconjugated to a 30 kD PEG (Fig. 4b), SAR'336 promoted Treg expansion with minimal changes in CD\\(8+\\) or NK cell frequencies. Quantification of the induction of biomarkers for activation and proliferation in peripheral blood revealed robust induction of pSTAT5, Kit-67, and CD25. Similarly, levels of FoxP3 and Helios, markers that correlate with differentiation and suppressive function of Tregs in peripheral blood, were also increased (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nSAR'336 engages IL-2R\\(\\alpha\\) with high affinity, but does not measurably interact with IL-2R\\(\\beta\\)\n\nAs the pegylation site in SAR'336 replaces a residue that makes direct contact with the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit at the IL-2/IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) interface, we hypothesized that this modification may cause differential binding kinetics to the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit. To understand the mechanism by which SAR'336 demonstrates a bias for stimulation of Treg proliferation and activation over CD\\(8+\\) and NK cells in NHP, we used SPR to directly measure binding.

Binding to the\n\nFig. 3: **H16 administration stimulates increased Treg expression of markers that correlate with Treg identity, activation and suppressive function.** H16 (0.9 mg/ kg) was administered via tail vein injection to C57BL/6 mice, and peripheral blood was recovered at intervals post dose. Multi-color flow cytometry was used to profile individual cell populations. The expression of CD25 (**a**), FoxP3 (**b**), Helios (**c**), ICOS receptors was monitored as the change in response units as a function of time during association and dissociation (wash) phases. On IL-2Ra surfaces, rhll-2 showed high affinity binding characterized by rapid association and slow dissociation kinetics (Fig. 6a, **upper left panel**, Supplementary Table 3). Similarly, SAR'336 interacted with high affinity with the IL-2Ra surface, with an approximately 3-fold reduction in affinity as expected for non-specific PEG effects on binding (Fig. 6a, **upper right panel**, Supplementary Table 3). In contrast, surfaces containing immobilized IL-2 RB showed robust association and dissociation responses with rhll-2 (Fig. 6a, **lower left panel**), while SAR'336 did not measurably engage the IL-2R subunit surface, even at high concentrations (Fig. 6a, **lower right panel**). These results suggest that SAR'336 retains interaction with the IL-2Ra subunit but lacks any measurable affinity to the IL-2RB subunit.\n\n### ", "SAR'336 specifically activates pSTAT5 expression in Tregs but not CD8 + T cells ex vivo": "\n\nTo determine how the reduced IL-2R$ affinity of SAR'336 affects activation of primary human immune cell subpopulations, we profiled the effect of this engineered cytokine on lymphocyte activation in human PBMC samples. In Treg populations, rhll-2 showed potential stimulation of pSTAT5 formation compared to SAR'336 (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table 4), suggesting that a slight reduction in IL-2Ra affinity and absence of IL-2RB engagement may significantly affect SAR'336 signaling compared to rhll-2. In CD8 + T and NK cell populations, SAR'336 was not observed to stimulate pSTAT5 phosphorylation (Fig. 6b), unlike rhll-2. With rhll-2, potency in NK cells is 120 - 250-fold less than that observed in Tregs. However, a similar ratio of pSTAT5 induction in NK cells and CD8 T cells was not observed with SAR'336, suggesting that SAR'336 may\n\nFig. 4: **Hi6 induces dose-dependent, large-scale Treg expansion and expression of biomarkers of differentiation and suppressive function in NHP.****a**, **b** H16 administration to NHP drives Treg expansion in a dose-dependent manner.

SAR336 induced higher frequencies of Treg cells in blood as well as secondary lymphoid organs compared to vehicle (Fig. 7b). After a single dose, 5-11% of cells in the circulation, lymph node, and spleen were CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs, which translates to a synchronized 5- to 15-fold increase in the percentage of Tregs after 3 days, and a lower increase in Treg frequency in the thymus peaking on day 8 (Fig. 7b). In a mouse ear model of KLH-induced DTH, repeat dosing of SAR336 induced dose-dependent increase in Treg frequency that peaked on day 3, the day of the second repeat dose, and remained elevated 10 days after the first dose (Fig. 8a). At 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg dose, SAR336-significantly suppressed the amount of ear swelling (Fig. 8a) as well as decreased inflammatory cell infiltration into ear tissue (Fig. 8b) at 0.3 mg/kg dose, following re-challenge with KLH.\n\n \n\n**Tregs treated with SAR'336 are potent suppressors of CD4\\(+\\) and CD8\\(+\\) T cell proliferation ex vivo**\n\nAs SAR'336 administration in mice stimulated the large-scale expansion of Treg populations, upregulation of markers that correlate with activity, and in vivo suppression of the DTH response, we hypothesized that the SAR'336-treated Treg populations have enhanced suppressive capacity compared to Tregs from naive animals.

These results suggest that SAR'336 effectively induces Tregs that have a significantly higher functional suppressive capacity.\n\n## ", "Discussion": "\n\nWhile study of the human cytokine IL-2 has been an area of intense focus in therapeutic development, efforts to utilize IL-2 and other cytokines for the treatment of immunologic disease has been challenging due to complex and pleiotropic signaling effects. In the case of IL-2, this cytokine displays dual functionality via both induction of immune responses through stimulation of proliferation of effector T (Teff) and NK cells, and control of immune responses through maintenance of Treg cells [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, N88 that modulate IL-2 potency to the IL-2 receptor beta subunit[31, 32, 33], our pegylation strategy enabled significantly differentiated properties to be identified in vitro and in vivo. The first step in this process was identification of residues that, when pegylated with a 30 kDa PEG modification, adjusted the cell-specific activity and potency of the resulting molecule. When the H16 variant of IL-2 was conjugated with a 50 kDa linear PEG, the larger conjugate was modestly reduced in potency (approx. twofold reduction in EC\\({}_{50\\text{s}}\\) the half-maximal effective concentration) relative to a 30 kDa PEG, as determined by pSTATS activation in Treg cells. However, a single SC dose of H16 with a 50 kDa PEG administered to cynomolus monkeys unexpectedly produced a much larger exposure relative to the 30 kDa PEG bio-conjugate (3.4X). SAR336 with a 50 kDa PEG also induced a larger and more persistent expansion of peripheral Treg cells in NHP relative to the 30 kDa PEG bioconjugate. We conclude that peripheral Treg expansion in response to SAR336 is exposure-driven, with the size the of PEG bioconjugate likely limiting renal filtration and improving both compound exposure and levels of Treg expansion.\n\nOur data show that SAR336 interactions with the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit are too weak to be measured using SPR. However, the current models for IL-2 receptor signaling suggest that recruitment of the IL-2R\\(\\beta\\) subunit is required for signaling[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 Teff and NK cells and these have shown remarkable Treg selectivity [23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. However, typical residues targeted by such muting occupy regions of the IL-2 protein that are enriched for P1 anchor sequences that allow peptide presentation on class II major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs). Indeed, initial variants that utilize these sites have generated anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation in human clinical trials, and we speculate that this may be a limitation of both the method and of the IL-2 variants that rely on this regional modification. While ADAs may limit the efficacy of a drug over time, muting that drive potential anti-drug immune responses may further lead to epitope spreading and neutralization of the patient's native protein [34, 35, 36], further limiting the use of these methods. In contrast, the mutien-generating approach presented here utilizes chemically stable covalent PEG modification, which may avoid involvement of steps in the class II MHC presentation pathway and limit subsequent immunogenicity and ADA formation, resulting in an overall safer therapeutic agent. The lack of ADA formation in clinical studies of the SAR44245 molecule further supports this contention [34].\n\nRecently, Zhang et al. [35] presented evidence of improved PK and immunosuppression by an engineered IL-2 molecule in mouse models of AI diseases by orthogonally conjugating with PEG via copper-free click reaction through incorporation of azide-containing amino acids using a canonical amber suppression method to incorporate \\(\\text{A}\\text{z}\\text{x}^{\\phi}\\). Unlike SAR336, which contains a 50 kDa PEG at site H16, these authors utilized 20 kDa PEG conjugations at Y31 and T51 to achieve their desired phenotype. Using a different approach, NKTR-358 conjugated native rhll-2 protein with PEG moieties using standard chemical coupling methodologies [36]. In a single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, NKTR-358 demonstrated a dose-dependent expansion of proliferating CD25\\(+\\) Treg cells. No measurable changes in the numbers and percentages of CD4\\(+\\) and CD8\\(+\\) T cells were seen, but low-level increases in NK cell numbers were observed at the highest doses tested [35]. Interestingly, the NKTR-358 compound has been reported to feature significant reductions in IL-2Ra, as well as IL-2Ra engagement, a substantial functional difference from SAR336. We speculate that these differences may arise due to the non-specific population chemistry used to generate the NKTR-358 molecule, which may target residues with undesired pharmacological consequences. Additional studies will be required to determine the differential and comparative pharmacology observed for these compounds compared to SAR336.\n\nIn the widening field of cytokine therapies for AI disorders, precision engineering of biologists will enable increased specificity and reduced off-target pleiotropy to be designed into natural immune regulatory cytokines. The application of the semi-synthetic genetic code technology to introduce site-specific and orthogonal chemistry via novel amino acids to achieve targeted bioconjugation of moieties led to the identification and design of SAR336, an improved, regulated IL-2 with enhanced PK and a more specific target binding profile. The concepts and strategies utilized here to\n\nFig. 9: **Tregs treated with SAR\u2019336 are potent suppressors of CD8 \\(+\\) T cell proliferation ex vivo. a Schematic of the experiment to measure ex vivo suppressive capacity of Treg: mice were administered either vehicle or SAR\u2019336 (0.3 mg/kg), and splenocytes populations were collected at 2 days post-dose. The CD4\\(+\\) Treg cells were isolated from the splenocytes derived from dosed and naive animals. Next, CD4 or CD8 \\(+\\) T cells were harvested from splenocytes from naive or vehicle-treated animals. To measure ex vivo suppressive capacity, Tregs were co-cultured at different ratios with CD4 or CD8 \\(+\\) T cells from naive or vehicle-treated animals. After 3 days of co-culture, the (b) CD4 \\(+\\) T cells and (c) CD8 \\(+\\) T cell populations from each improve IL-2 have potential for future development of other biologic scaffolds that would benefit from the site-specific modulation of potency, MHC-II epitope protection, and receptor specificity afforded by our technology. Together, the findings presented here demonstrate that SAR'336 is a specific activator of Treg proliferation and suppressive function, with minimal expansion of Tefs and NK cells populations. These results from mouse and NHP models support the continued development of SAR'336 as a clinical development candidate for treatment of AI-related disorders.\n\n## ", "Data availability": "\n\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the studies reported herein are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

In celebration of 25 years of _Statistics in Medicine_, this paper will review developments in cluster randomized trials, particularly, but not exclusively, those published in the journal.\n\nCluster randomized trials are now a key tool in the evaluation of interventions in health services research. They are widely used and two main types of trial are as follows: (1) interventions that involve training or education of health professionals, with the aim of finding a benefit for patients; (2) community randomized trials where the clusters are complete communities (some authors call these 'large field trials'). These are generally characterized by a relatively small number of clusters each enrolling a large number of subjects. A well-known example of this is the COMMIT smoking intervention trial to be discussed in Section 3.\n\nIt is worth defining a few terms first. The _intraclass correlation (ICC)_ is the ratio of the between cluster variance to the total variance of an outcome variable and is often denoted by \\(\\rho\\). Different designs can lead to different formulas for estimating \\(\\rho\\). The _design effect (DE)_ is the ratio of the variance of an outcome measure when clustering is accounted for to the variance of the outcome measure when clustering is not accounted for. It is often referred to as the _variance inflation factor_, since DE measures the amount that one should increase a variance estimate obtained by ignoring clustering to allow for the clustering effect. For clusters of equal size \\(m\\), it can be shown that \\(\\mbox{DE}\\!=\\!1+(m-1)\\rho\\). Extensions of this formula to the case of variable cluster sizes are given in Section 2.4.\n\nThere have been a number of reviews of cluster randomized trials. In 2001 and in _Statistics in Medicine_, Klar and Donner [2], following on from their book [3] published the previous year, reviewed developments up until that time and suggested areas of further research. These areas included: ethical issues; sample size estimation; analytic issues; economic analysis; meta-analysis of cluster randomized trials and recommendations for trial reporting. The analytic issues included population averaged _versus_ cluster specific (CS) models, methods involving a small number of clusters, issues arising from matched paired designs, overlapping cluster membership, and issues involving missing data. Some related issues were also covered more recently by the same authors [4]. Methodological developments for cluster randomized trials have also been reviewed by Murray _et al._[5]. This paper will update the earlier reviews, in particular the 2001 review in _Statistics in Medicine_.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. Sections 2-4 concern design issues: Section 2 presents issues concerning power and sample size, Section 3 matched pair designs and Section 4 cohort _versus_ cross-sectional designs. In Section 5 we will discuss issues in the analysis of cluster randomized trials. Section 6 describes issues on presentation and reporting and Section 7 deals with some further issues.\n\n## 2 Issues arising in the assessment of power and sample size\n\n### Number of clusters and number of subjects per cluster\n\nOften the number of clusters available to be enrolled in a cluster randomized trial is limited. This has led to considerable interest in developing reliable methods of sample size estimation. Two early papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ reviewed sample size issues in clinical trials in general [6] and particularly in cluster randomized trials [7]. Although values of \\(\\rho\\) in cluster randomized trials tend to be small (typically around 0.05 for primary care trials [8]) and in community randomized trials even smaller (usually less than 0.01 and often near 0.001 [3]) the resulting DE may be very substantial when combined with clusters of large size. Thus, the practice of ignoring clustering effects in the design stage of a trial can lead to an elevated type 2 error, while ignoring it at the analysis stage inevitably leads to an elevated type 1 error.\n\n In cluster randomized trials there are often two sample size choices to be made: the number of clusters and the number of subjects per cluster. A useful rule of thumb is that the power does not increase appreciably once the number of subjects per cluster exceeds \\(1/\\rho\\)[4]. Thus, if it is believed that the ICC is about 0.05 then it is not worth enrolling more than about 20 subjects per cluster. However, if the ICC is near 0.001, which is often typical of community intervention trials, then a sample of 1000 subjects per cluster may be worthwhile, particularly if recruiting new clusters is difficult.\n\nThe sample size formulas we give here assume that data for sample size estimation are obtained from a single sample of clusters from the population of interest, that is the intervention itself has no effect on the cluster size. Examples where this is not true have been given by Campbell [8], and we will return to this topic in Section 7.2.\n\n### Sample sizes for trials involving survival data\n\nOne of the earliest (and highest cited) papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ is by Freedman [9] on the sample size required in a study when the outcome is survival. The total number of events, \\(e\\), required for a power \\(\\beta\\) and two-sided significance \\(\\alpha\\) to detect an expected hazard ratio \\(\\theta\\) is given by\n\n\\[e=(z_{\\alpha/2}+z_{\\beta})^{2}\\frac{(1+\\phi\\theta)^{2}}{\\phi(1-\\theta)^{2}}\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and \\(z_{\\beta}\\) are the normal ordinates associated with probabilities \\(\\alpha/2\\) and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\phi\\) is the ratio of the sample size in group 2 to group 1 and \\(\\theta\\) is the expected hazard ratio between groups 2 and 1.\n\nXie and Waksman [10] generalized equation (1) to cluster randomized trials. An important issue in applying this formula is whether one should estimate \\(\\rho\\) from the clustered survival data or, alternatively, from the censoring indicators. Xie and Waksman [10] chose to estimate \\(\\rho\\) from the indicators, since this approach is widely used in the clustered binary data literature. Thus, in what follows \\(\\rho\\) is estimated as a simple correlation of the 0,1's indicating whether or not an event is censored, although further research on this estimation question would be useful. They found that the number of events \\(e_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) required is a simple generalization of Freedman's formula:\n\n\\[e_{\\mathrm{c}}=e(1+(\\overline{m}-1)\\rho)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\overline{m}=\\sum_{i=1}^{K}m_{i}/K\\), is the average number of subjects per cluster and \\(K\\) is the number of clusters.\n\nThe number of subjects required is then given by\n\n\\[n=\\frac{(1+\\phi)e_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\overline{m}((1-P_{1})+\\phi(1-P_{2}))}\\]\n\nwhere \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) are the proportion of individuals with non-events in groups 1 and 2.\n\n### Allowing for imprecision in the ICC\n\nMuch of the sample size literature deals with the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates of between-community variation, and hence of \\(\\rho\\), that are needed for sample size planning.\n\n In practice estimates of \\(\\rho\\) for a given outcome variable are usually derived from previously reported studies using similar randomization units. However, these estimates are frequently based on studies which themselves are of small size, and thus their inherent inaccuracy may lend the investigators a false sense of confidence.\n\nUkoumunne [11] has given a series of methods for calculating confidence intervals for the ICC, including an application of the bootstrap. However, it is difficult to know how to use these for planning purposes. As Turner _et al_. [12] have pointed out, for planning purposes it may be better to select a design on the basis of power averaged across uncertainty rather than calculate power from an informally assessed ICC value. Moreover, substitution of a conservative ICC such as the upper value from a 95 per cent confidence interval usually reduces the power for a fixed sample size estimate much more than a method which allows for the imprecision of the ICC. They discuss the use of prior distributions for the ICC and in a Bayesian context show how the uncertainty about this parameter can be expressed in the form of a parametric distribution which naturally leads to a distribution of projected power for any particular design. This Bayesian approach towards the determination of sample size could then be followed by a statistical analysis within the traditional frequentist framework. Turner _et al_. [12] showed that increasing the number of clusters enables the total sample size to be reduced for a given power. With a given number of subjects estimated from an unclustered design, increasing the number of clusters also considerably reduces the lower limit of the posterior distribution of power. In other words, uncertainty in the ICC will produce uncertainty in the actual power of a study, but a design based on a greater number of clusters has less chance of having a very low power.\n\nAn alternative approach to dealing with uncertainty in observed values of \\(\\rho\\) is described by Feng and Grizzle [13], who proposed the use of a method similar in principle to the bootstrap procedure. Their approach requires the simulation of results of studies of the same size that yielded the observed estimate. One then can substitute the values of \\(\\rho\\) obtained from each simulation into the appropriate sample size formula to generate a distribution of projected powers, followed by the selection of a point on this distribution, e.g. the 90th percentile, that reflects the degree of conservativeness desired.\n\n### Allowing for varying cluster sizes\n\nVariation in cluster size is another source of imprecision and Kerry and Bland [14] following Donner _et al_. [15] suggest using\n\n\\[\\mathrm{DE}=1+(m_{a}-1)\\rho\\quad\\mathrm{where}\\ m_{a}=\\sum m_{i}^{2}/\\sum m_{i}\\] (2)\n\nThe problem of using this formula is that the individual cluster sizes must be known prior to conducting the trial.\n\nEldridge _et al_. [16] modified (2) to give\n\n\\[\\mathrm{DE}=1+\\left(\\left(\\mathrm{cv}^{2}\\frac{(k-1)}{k}+1\\right)\\overline{m }-1\\right)\\rho\\] (3)\n\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{cv}=s_{m}/\\overline{m}\\) and \\(s_{m}\\) is the s.d. of the cluster size. They suggest that formula (3) is more practical than (2) since the value of \\(\\mathrm{cv}\\) (coefficient of variation) may often be known in advance. Eldridge _et al_. [16] also provide some examples of the coefficient of variation for sample sizes typically seen in cluster randomized trials. A further issue is that the estimated ICC will have sampling variation. Eldridge _et al_. [16] give an empirical correction for the DE in this case.\n\n This formula is appropriate for cluster level analyses that weight by cluster size. For the much more common GEE analysis, which we describe in Section 5, this formula is likely to be conservative.\n\n### Sample size re-estimation\n\nWhen prior knowledge of the value of the variance components required to ascertain the sample size is unavailable, we can undertake an internal pilot study to provide these estimates, using a well cited paper in this area by Wittes and Brittain [17], and as extended to cluster randomized trials by Lake _et al._[18]. With this approach, several nuisance parameters, including \\(\\rho\\), the mean cluster size and measures of cluster size variation, are estimated at an interim point in the study, followed by re-estimation of the final required trial size. Although this procedure is most suited to trials that randomize a relatively large number of clusters, such as families or households, over an extended period of time, Lake _et al._[18] point out that it could also be applied to at least some community intervention trials provided the participating clusters are recruited prospectively. Turner _et al._[12] state that imprecision in the estimate of \\(\\rho\\) is not accounted for in this application, but their own method could easily be extended to do so. More experience on the application of internal pilot studies to such trials is clearly needed.\n\n### Empirical investigations of design effects\n\nEmpirical investigations of design effects likely to arise in cluster randomized trials implemented in a specific setting are also helpful to investigators. An example of such an investigation is given by Mickey _et al._[19], who presented design effects from a trial designed to intervene on breast cancer mortality. Ukoumunne _et al._[20] presented variance components for some common outcomes, as did Gulliford _et al._[21].\n\nSeveral authors have shown that adjusting for covariates either at the community or individual-level can improve the power of a trial by reducing the magnitude of the between-cluster variation [8, 22]. Additional gains in power may be realized by modelling individual level covariates (e.g. age) and also at the cluster level (e.g. mean cluster age) as described by Klar and Darlington [23].\n\n## 3 Issues in the design and analysis of matched pair community randomized trials\n\n### Design of matched pair studies\n\nMatched pair studies are not frequently seen in clinical trials randomizing individual subjects to different intervention groups. However, they have proved to be the design of choice for many investigators embarking on a community intervention trial, largely because of the perceived ability of this design to create intervention groups that are comparable at baseline with respect to important prognostic factors, including, for example, community size and geographic area. The relatively small number of communities that can be enrolled in such studies further enhances the attractiveness of pair matching as a method of reducing the probability of substantively important imbalances that may detract from the credibility of the reported results. _Statistics in Medicine_ has been the forum for much of the debate surrounding the advantages and disadvantages of this design.\n\n Freedman _et al_. [24] were among the first authors to investigate the gain in efficiency obtained from matching in a community intervention trial. This was done in the context of COMMIT (Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation), a community programme designed to encourage citizens to stop smoking. As discussed by Gail _et al_. [25], 11 pairs of communities were matched on the basis of several factors expected to be related to the smoking quit rates, such as community size, geographical proximity and demographic profile. Within each matched pair, one community was allocated at random to the intervention group, with the other acting as the control. It is also interesting to note that this trial was one of the first large-scale community intervention studies to use formal power considerations at the planning stage, and, perhaps not coincidentally, to be substantially larger in size than its predecessors.\n\nAssuming the gain in efficiency due to matching may be quantified by the factor \\(G=1/(1-\\rho_{m})\\), where \\(\\rho_{m}\\) is the correlation between members of a pair with respect to the outcome variable, Freedman _et al_. [24] showed that matching can lead to considerable gains in statistical precision when it is based on an effective surrogate for outcome. However, since \\(G\\) is simply the ratio of population variances ignoring or accounting for pair-matching, it does not take into account the difference in degrees of freedom for estimating these variances, a factor which is particularly relevant in trials enrolling a small number of communities. For example, in the COMMIT study, the degrees of freedom available for estimating error from the paired differences in event rates would be only 10, as compared to the 20 degrees of freedom available for an unmatched analysis.\n\nThis issue was subsequently addressed in detail by Martin _et al_. [26], who evaluated the relative efficiency of a matched to an unmatched analysis by using percentiles of the non-central \\(t\\)-distribution to account for the differences in degrees of freedom. On the basis of these results they concluded that for studies having no more than 20 pairs, matching should be used for the purpose of increasing power only if the investigators are confident that \\(\\rho_{m}\\) exceeds 0.20. By considering the practical difficulties that often arise in securing 'good' matches, they also concluded more generally that 'matching may be overused as a design tool' in community intervention trials.\n\nThese considerations suggest that a tempting strategy in practice may be to perform an unmatched analysis of data arising from a matched pair design, particularly when matching is adopted mainly for the purpose of avoiding a 'bad' randomization. The effectiveness of such a strategy was investigated by Diehr _et al_. [27], who concluded on the basis of an extensive simulation study that breaking the matches can actually result in an increase in power when the number of pairs is less than ten. Thus, the loss in precision identified by Martin _et al_. [26] in the presence of weak matching correlations can be at least partially regained.\n\nA secondary objective of many community intervention trials is to investigate the effect of individual-level risk factors on one or more outcome variables. Focusing on the case of a continuous outcome variable, Donner _et al_. [28] showed that the practice of performing an unmatched analysis on data arising from a pair-matched design can lead to bias in the estimated regression coefficient, and a corresponding test of significance which is overly liberal. However, for large-scale community intervention trials, which typically recruit a relatively small number of large clusters, such an analysis will generally be both valid and efficient.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly adopted matching factors in large-scale community randomized trials have been cluster size and geographic area (e.g. urban _versus_ rural). Matching by cluster size is attractive not only because it protects against large imbalances in the number of subjects per intervention group, an efficiency consideration, but also because cluster size may be associated with other important but unaccounted for baseline variables, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care resources (Lewsey [29]). Matching by categorized levels of baseline versions of the trial outcome rate would also seem attractive. However, results reported by Feng _et al_. [22] suggest that if primary interest is changed from the baseline, such matching is not likely to add benefits in power beyond that yielded by an analysis of change scores.\n\n### Limitations of matched pair designs\n\nKlar and Donner [30] explored some further limitations of the matched pair designs that are more general in nature. These limitations arise largely from the total confounding of the intervention effect with the natural variation that exists between two members of a matched pair. One consequence of such confounding is that it precludes the use of standard methods for estimating the underlying ICC, which in turn reduces analytic flexibility. For example, a secondary objective of many studies is to estimate the effect of selected individual level risk factors on one or more outcome variables using regression modelling. However, the calculation of appropriate standard errors for the regression coefficients obtained from such a model requires a valid estimator of \\(\\rho\\). Thus, although it is possible to perform adjustments for the effect of such risk factors using a two-stage residualized approach e.g. Gail _et al_. [31], the task of testing for their independent relationship with outcome is more difficult (Donner _et al_. [28]). Moreover the matched pair design frequently does not bring large gains in precision. This led Klar and Donner [30] to recommend that greater attention be paid to the possibility of adopting a stratified design, in which two or more clusters are randomized to each intervention group within the strata. This design may be particularly attractive when investigators find it challenging to create matched pairs that correspond to unique estimates of risk for each pair. Most importantly, the cluster level replication inherent in this less rigid allocation scheme removes many of the analytic limitations associated with pair-matching, while increasing the degrees of freedom available for estimating error.\n\n## 4 Other design issues\n\n### Cohort versus cross-sectional designs\n\nMany community intervention trials are longitudinal in nature, allowing a choice between a cohort design and a cross-sectional design. For a cohort design, clusters are randomly assigned to intervention groups, with or without stratification. Cohorts sampled from each cluster are then measured over two or more time points, with at least the first measurement occurring before randomization. The cross-sectional design is similar, except that samples are selected independently within each cluster at each time point. Because responses within the same subject often have a strong positive correlation, the cohort design is theoretically more efficient.\n\nFeldman and McKinlay [32] presented a unified statistical model that embraces both designs as special cases, thus allowing an assessment of how the values of different design parameters affect their relative precision. A principal conclusion from their investigation was that cohort designs have unique disadvantages that may outweigh any advantage in theoretical efficiency. The first of these is related to possible instability in cohorts of large size, with the resulting likelihood of subject loss to follow-up. Although this disadvantage can be compensated for by oversampling at baseline, this might well negate the original reasons for adopting a cohort design. Differential loss to follow-up by intervention group also creates the risk of bias.\n\nThe second disadvantage is related to the issue of representativeness of the target population, which is invariably hampered by the ageing of the cohort over time. Assuming that changes related to the ageing process are independent of the intervention assignment, this effect will not invalidate the principal comparison of interest. However, it does imply that a difference observed in a cohort trial with respect to a given outcome variable cannot be directly compared to the corresponding difference between observed cross-sectional samples. Thus, if the primary questions of interest focus on change at the community level rather than at the level of the individual, cohort samples are the less natural choice. This point is discussed by others [33, 34], who describe and compare several approaches that might be taken to the analysis of repeated cross-sectional samples. Additional discussion is provided by Murray _et al_. [35].\n\n### Practical design issues\n\nThere are two useful papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ that look at practical issues for the conduct of cluster randomized trials. Flynn _et al_. [36] address the issue of whether it is worth recruiting an extra cluster or to recruit more individuals to existing clusters. They show how the use of contour graphs of power by number of clusters per treatment arm and cluster size can be usefully exploited. Moerbeek [37] suggests that often a cheaper strategy than recruiting another cluster would be to measure additional covariates related to the outcome, in order to reduce the variance. This, of course, requires the cost of measuring the covariate to be relatively small and the correlation of the covariate and the outcome to be reasonably high.\n\n## 5 Issues in the analysis of cluster randomized trials\n\n### Cluster specific versus marginal models\n\nConsider an outcome variable \\(Y\\) (which may be continuous or binary), with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and a generalized link of the form\n\n\\[g(\\mu)=\\eta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X+Z\\] (4)\n\nwhere the function \\(g\\) is assumed strictly monotone and differentiable. We further assume that \\(Z\\) is a random variable \\(E(Z)=0\\) and \\(\\operatorname{var}(Z)=\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\) and so is independent of the fixed effect \\(X\\).\n\nEquation (4) may be a suitable model for clustered data. We assume that the clusters are sampled from a larger population and the effect of any particular cluster \\(i\\) is to add a random effect \\(Z_{i}\\) to all the outcomes. For a cluster randomized we could set \\(X=1\\) for intervention and \\(X=0\\) for control. A CS model measures the effect on \\(Y\\) of changing \\(X\\), while \\(Z\\) is held constant. This is a common model for longitudinal data, where it is possible to imagine, say in a cross-over trial, a treatment value changing over time. However, in a cluster randomized, everyone in a cluster receives the same treatment, and although a CS model can be fitted, the result can be interpreted only theoretically. The alternative is to fit a model which looks at the average effect of \\(X\\) over the range of \\(Z\\). This is the so-called _population averaged_ (\\(PA\\)) or _marginal_ model.\n\nConsider a model where we fit only \\(X\\), so that\n\n\\[\\eta=\\beta_{0}^{*}+\\beta_{1}^{*}X\\] (5)\n\nFitting model (5) is equivalent to fitting a PA model, that is we estimate the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) as averaged over all the clusters \\(Z\\).\n\nNeuhaus and Jewell [38] approach the contrast between CS models and PA models by observing that model (5) is simply model (4) with the variable \\(Z\\) omitted. If we assume that the coefficients for \\(X\\) in the two models are related by \\(\\beta_{1}^{*}\\approx B\\,\\beta\\), where \\(B\\) is the bias factor, then they show that for a linear model \\(B=1\\), and so the interpretation of CS and marginal models is the same. However, for a logistic link, \\(\\mu=\\log\\)it(\\(P\\,(Y=1\\,|\\,X,\\,Z)\\) is a random variable and\n\n\\[B=1-\\frac{\\sigma_{z}^{2}}{E(\\mu)\\{1-E(\\mu)\\}}=1-\\rho\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the correlation of the \\(Y\\)'s within clusters assuming \\(\\beta_{1}=0\\). Since, as discussed earlier, the value of \\(\\rho\\) in community randomized trials is usually less than 0.01, this suggests that the bias in incorrectly assuming a marginal model should not be great.\n\nIn this case 0\\(<\\)\\(B<\\)1, so the general effect of using a PA model is to attenuate the regression coefficient. One can also see that for a logistic link the greater the variability of the random variable \\(Z\\), and so the greater the intracluster correlation, the greater the attenuation.\n\nNeuhaus and Jewell [38] also show that \\(B=1\\) for a log link, which would suggest that in prospective studies such as clinical trials it would be advantageous to use a log-linear model which estimates the relative risk rather than a logistic model for odds ratios. Until recently the software for accurately estimating the standard errors of the estimates for cluster log-linear models was not available, but Zou [39] has recently demonstrated how it can be done using Poisson regression and robust standard errors.\n\nThe fact that log-linear models estimate the same population parameter for CS and marginal models does not appear well known. For example Murray _et al._[5] state that 'in the case of binary data the coefficient from a marginal model is smaller than that from a conditional model...'.\n\n### Inflating the standard error\n\nFor a linear model we write\n\n\\[y_{ij}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+Z_{i}+\\varepsilon_{ij}\\] (6)\n\nwhere \\(y_{ij}\\) is the outcome of the \\(j\\)th subject (\\(j=1,\\ldots,\\,K\\)) in the \\(i\\)th cluster (\\(i=1,\\ldots,\\,m_{j}\\)), and we assume \\(E(\\varepsilon_{ij})=E(Z_{i})=0\\), \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) and \\(Z_{i}\\) are independent, \\(V(\\varepsilon_{ij})=\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(V(Z_{i})=\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Here \\(X_{i}\\) is an intervention indicator variable (\\(0\\), \\(1\\)) which depends only on the cluster. An _exchangeable_ correlation structure is assumed, which effectively means that one can exchange subjects \\(j\\) and \\(j^{\\prime}\\) within a cluster without changing the covariance. This breaks down if the subjects are measured more than once (for example, at baseline and at follow-up) since the correlation of the same subject measured twice will not be the same as the correlation of two different subjects within a cluster. It also means that the ICC must be assumed to be the same within each arm of the trial, an assumption which is guaranteed in a randomized trial under the null hypothesis of no intervention effect.\n\nWe can rewrite (6) as\n\n\\[y_{ij}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+\\eta_{ij}\\] (7)\n\nwhere the \\(\\eta_{ij}\\) are random errors which are not independent, but are typically assumed to have an exchangeable structure defined by the clusters. This is the PA model described in Section 5.1.\n\nWe can fit model (7) but not account for the correlated nature of the errors terms. Provided that \\(Z_{i}\\) is uncorrelated with \\(X_{i}\\) then we get a valid estimate of the treatment effect but the standard error of the treatment effect is underestimated, and should be inflated. A technique originating in sample survey research is to simply multiply the standard error by the DE. For example, the DE given in Section 1 may be estimated by replacing the ICC with its sample estimate [3]. A simple test of whether a parameter is zero, known as a modified Wald test, is to divide an estimate of the parameter by its modified standard error which is then compared to a standard normal distribution. Donner and Klar [3] give a number of methods for continuous and binary outcomes which modify the standard error associated with either the \\(t\\)-test or the chi-squared test, respectively. It is important to note that the estimate of the treatment effect is unchanged, only the standard error is inflated. An alternative method is to use the so-called 'sandwich' or Huber-White estimator which has a long history in econometrics for estimators with continuous data and with heterogeneous variances. This fits a model where the variance of the error term \\(V(\\eta)=\\sigma_{i}^{2}\\) is not assumed constant, and is estimated through the residuals of the model. The advantage of the robust standard error is that one does not need to estimate the ICC separately before conducting the analysis. The disadvantage is that it may be less efficient and so would need a greater number of clusters than does use of the model-dependent standard error. The use of robust standard errors for cluster randomized trials was first suggested by Brook _et al._[40], and implemented in a number of statistical packages, for example in _Stata_ by Rogers [41].\n\nIn general, Donner and Klar's [3] methods which adjust the standard error give an estimate of the treatment effect which, in effect, weights each cluster by the size of the cluster, so that larger clusters have greater weight. An alternative is to use the method of summary measures, as popularized by Matthews _et al._[42]. This gives equal weight to each cluster, irrespective of size and is a CS method. This approach has a great deal to recommend it since it simply uses the summary statistics (mean or proportion) for each cluster and is easy to apply without specialist software. However, one cannot adjust for individual level covariates directly using this approach.\n\n### Fitting models to data\n\nThe generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, developed by Liang and Zeger [43] in the context of longitudinal studies, has proved to very popular for the analysis of data arising from cluster randomized trials. It fits the PA model and uses an iteratively reweighting algorithm to estimate the parameters and a robust method for the standard error. Use of the GEE is a 'shrinkage' approach which is a compromise between no weighting and weighting by the sample size. Assuming an exchangeable correlation structure, it effectively weights each mean by \\(m_{i}/(m_{i}\\sigma_{z}^{2}+\\sigma^{2})\\), which weights the means by the sample size when \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}=0\\) and gives equal weight when \\(\\sigma^{2}=0\\). In practice, estimates of the variance components are used.\n\nThe analysis of continuous data is relatively straightforward and a comparison of maximum likelihood assuming a normal mixed model, GEE, a bootstrap and a '4-stage method' have been given by Feng _et al._[44]. The bootstrap used by Feng _et al._ draws a random sample of size \\(K\\) from the original \\(K\\) clusters. Then one can use ordinary least squares to estimate the \\(\\beta\\)'s and repeat a large number of times. The four stage method is non-iterative, where the first step is to estimate the \\(\\beta\\)'s by ordinary least squares and obtain the residuals \\(e_{i}=Y_{i}-X_{i}\\widehat{\\beta}\\). Then the \\(e_{i}\\)'s are regressed against the \\(Z_{i}\\)'s, leading to estimates of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). One can then use these estimates in a weighted least squares regression of \\(Y_{i}\\)_versus_\\(X_{i}\\).\n\nFor small numbers of clusters (\\(<\\)10 per arm) and for near balanced data the bootstrap has been shown to do well, especially if one does not wish to assume normality. For larger numbers of clusters, the maximum likelihood method performed better than GEE.\n\nGEE is used widely for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction because it can control for the influence of potential confounders on outcome without the need to specify an underlying distribution for the sample observations. The robust variance estimation relies on between-cluster information to assure the validity of the resulting inferences. It is therefore important to be wary of this approach to community intervention trials, where the amount of such information tends to be relatively small.\n\nFeng _et al_. [44] recommended for continuous data that GEE should not be applied to trials having 20 or fewer communities. Recent research has shown that for studies enrolling few clusters one should take account of the fact that the observed residuals, which are used in robust estimation, are biased estimates of the error variable, because of the requirement that they sum to zero. This bias can be removed by dividing the squared error by the diagonal of the 'hat' matrix. It has also been found that using a \\(t\\)-distribution (or a Satterthwaite type degrees of freedom correction) and a jack-knife improves the estimate of the standard error [45, 46, 47]. Pan and Wall [47] proposed replacing the GEE Wald test by approximate \\(t\\)- or \\(F\\)-tests. Although the proposed procedures showed type 1 errors closer to nominal than the usual Wald test, they were shown to be strictly applicable only in clusters of small sizes. It is therefore clear that more research is needed on the development of adjusted GEE procedures that can be applied to clusters of the size that typically arise in community intervention trials.\n\nRecently Guo _et al_. [48] discussed not only the use of a robust standard error in the Wald test, but also the robust score test, particularly for cluster randomized trials. They show that the use of the Wald test is too liberal (more likely to give a significant value) and the score test is too conservative and suggest that a simple correction \\(K/(K-1)\\) to the score statistic will give a test size closer to the nominal value.\n\nIt is worth commenting that the use of the sandwich estimator has been associated with the GEE method so many times that they may appear synonymous. In fact they are not, and one can use robust standard error without GEE as described in Section 5.2.\n\n### Analysis of binary data\n\nAs discussed in Section 5.1 binary models can estimate different population parameters and so deserve special consideration.\n\nLet \\(Y_{ij}\\) (0 or 1) be the \\(j\\)th observation (\\(j=1,\\,\\ldots,\\,m_{i}\\)) in the \\(i\\)th cluster (\\(i=1,\\,2,\\,\\ldots,\\,K\\)). The intervention variable is \\(X_{i}\\) (0 or 1). The CS logistic model is\n\n\\[\\log it\\,(\\pi_{ij})=\\beta_{0}+\\beta X_{i}+Z_{i}\\] (8)\n\nwhere \\(Z_{i}\\) is the effect of being in cluster \\(i\\) and where \\(\\pi_{ij}=E(Y_{ij}|X_{i},\\,Z_{i})\\). This model can be extended to include individual specific covariates \\(X_{ij}\\). The random variable \\(Z_{i}\\) is assumed independent of \\(X_{i}\\) and is usually assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Given the \\(Z_{i}\\), the \\(Y_{ij}\\)'s are assumed independently distributed with binomial parameter \\(\\pi_{ij}\\).\n\nRecently Heo and Leon [49] compared different methods of analysis under (8): (i) full likelihood; (ii) penalized quasi-likelihood; (iii) GEE and (iv) fixed effects logistic regression. The third method is a marginal method which, following the discussion in Section 5.1, estimates a different population parameter than the regression coefficient in (8). However, it does not require one to assume a normal distribution for the \\(Z_{i}\\). The last method does not take the ICC into account, and is an invalid method in general for cluster randomized trials. However if \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}=0\\) it may be expected to yield valid tests and efficient estimates.\n\n The full likelihood \\(L\\) is given by\n\n\\[L=\\prod_{i=1}^{K}\\int\\prod_{j=1}^{m_{i}}\\mu_{ij}(\\beta,\\,Z_{i})^{y_{ij}}\\{1-\\mu_{ ij}(\\beta,\\,Z_{i})\\}^{1-y_{ij}}\\,f\\,(Z_{i};\\,\\sigma^{2})\\,\\mathrm{d}Z_{i}\\] (9)\n\nwhere \\(f(.)\\) is the normal distribution function.\n\nEquation (9) can be maximized using Gaussian quadrature or other numerical methods to obtain estimates of the regression coefficients.\n\nPenalized quasi-likelihood is a method of maximizing the likelihood whilst avoiding the integration, using a Laplace method for approximating the integral (Breslow and Clayton [50]).\n\nHeo and Leon [49] found that the full likelihood method and the penalized likelihood methods to be similar and no worse than the fixed effects method even when the within-cluster correlations are zero. As expected the GEE method gave biased estimates of \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\). They did not investigate the effects of estimating \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{PA}}\\).\n\nPreisser _et al_. [51] showed how to apply a PA model to a pre-test post-test cross-sectional design, where the assumption of an exchangeable correlation matrix breaks down. They state that the GEE approach is asymptotically equivalent to the summary measure approach, and quote Mancl and De Rouen [46] to the effect that using bias-corrected variances can yield valid test sizes even with unequal cluster sizes and with as few as 10 clusters.\n\n### Bayesian methods\n\nThe likelihood given in (9) requires numerical integration to solve. An alternative method is to use simulation via Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms. These are normally associated with a Bayesian analysis, but choice of suitable non-informative priors will yield results similar to the conventional likelihood methods.\n\nSpiegelhalter [52] described the method for the Bayesian analysis of cluster randomized trials with a continuous response. This was extended to a binary outcome by Turner _et al_. [53].\n\nThey used model (8) and looked at different prior distributions for \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Since \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\) is closely related to the ICC, they argued that often it is more appropriate to use a prior distribution on the ICC, since prior information on the ICC is now becoming available [21, 22]. They experimented with different prior distributions and showed that the estimate of the treatment effect is not entirely robust to the distributional assumptions of the model, and suggested caution in using the conventional normality assumption. They contrasted their results to an earlier study by Omar and Thompson [54] who used a multilevel model and a penalized quasi-likelihood procedure to obtain the estimates. Turner _et al_. [53] showed that the variance components tend to be underestimated when using the non-Bayesian approach.\n\nThompson _et al_. [55] argue that often in a clinical trial one is interested in a risk difference rather than an odds ratio, and describe how to carry out a Bayesian analysis in such a situation.\n\n### Modelling in matched pairs designs\n\nThompson _et al_. [56] replaced standard modelling approaches by techniques borrowed from meta-analysis. Thus, an intervention/control pair replaces an individual clinical trial of a meta-analysis. This is essentially equivalent to relying on between-stratum information to estimate \\(\\rho\\) under the assumption of no intervention by stratum interaction. An attractive feature of this is that the forest plot can show which pairs appear to be outliers. However, this approach requires a large number of strata (pairs) to ensure its validity, and is therefore not applicable to many community intervention studies.\n\nThe meta-analysis method as applied to the matched pairs design was extended to binary data by Alexander and Emerson [57] using a Bayesian approach. Their technique was illustrated by applying it to incidence rates of trachoma in Africa. Methods that may be applied to data arising from a stratified cluster randomized design are discussed by Dobbins and Simpson [58] and Song and Ahn [59]. However, they restrict themselves to a comparison of the performance of specific tests in terms of the size and power, rather than on the general problem of estimation.\n\nThe strict lack of applicability of the \\(t\\)-test to binary outcomes in a matched pair design has led some investigators to alternatively recommend non-parametric approaches, such as Fisher's one sample randomization (permutation) test. Simulations performed by Gail _et al._[31] showed that inferences for matched pair binary data using permutation procedures will have significance levels near nominal under conditions likely to arise in community intervention trials. Essentially, the same conclusions were reached by Brookmeyer and Chen [60] for person-time data arising from matched pair trials. It is useful to note, however, that the one sample permutation test requires a minimum of six pairs to yield a two-sided \\(p\\)-value of less than 0.05, reflecting its relatively weak power. Donner and Donald [61] showed that a weighted paired \\(t\\)-test based on a logistic transformation of the crude event rates tends to be more powerful than both the permutation test and the standard paired \\(t\\)-test in trials having a small number of strata.\n\n## 6 Presenting data\n\n### CONSORT statement\n\nIt is a perennial complaint amongst analysts that cluster randomized trials are poorly reported [62]. The original CONSORT statement was an attempt to improve reporting of individually randomized trials. This statement was subsequently adapted for cluster randomized trials, published in _Statistics in Medicine_[63], and has been well cited. It has now been revised and published in a medical journal [64, 65]. The most important distinctions from the original are: (i) to give a rationale for adopting a cluster design; (ii) to describe how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the sample size calculations; (iii) to describe how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the analysis; and (iv) to describe the flow of both clusters and participants through the trial, from assignment to analysis. Thus, in a primary care trial, for example, one would like to know how many primary care groups were approached, how many agreed to participate, how many were randomized, and how many dropped out during the trial, as well as the characteristics of the patients in the study. The most up-to-date statement is available at www.consort-statement.org\n\n### Improvements in reporting\n\nA recent review by Bland [66] contrasted the years 1983, 88, 93, 98 and 2003. He suggests that cluster randomized trials are becoming more prevalent and the presentation of cluster randomized trials has improved, particularly after 1998. He suggests that statistical pressure has contributed to this and it is of note that the two seminal books were published in that period [3, 67].\n\n \n\n## 7 Other Considerations\n\n### Clustering by practitioner\n\nInvestigators may need to contend with clustering of subjects' responses even for trials using individual randomization. For example, patients may be randomized as they enter a trial by whether or not they will receive a new intervention (say acupuncture). However, there may be a limited number of acupuncturists and so a single acupuncturist may treat a number of patients. The outcomes will thus be affected not only by whether the patient received acupuncture but by which acupuncturist.\n\nThe model is\n\n\\[y_{ijk}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+\\gamma Z_{k}+\\varepsilon_{ij}\\]\n\nwhere the subscript \\(k\\) indicates the effect of different acupuncturists and \\(Z_{k}=0\\) for the control group. However, it is important to note that the subjects in the control group are not naturally clustered. Issues in the analysis of these trials have been covered by Roberts and Roberts [68]. Lee and Thompson [69] discuss a Bayesian approach to the analysis of such trials, and point out that taking into account clustering in the analysis can affect the results.\n\n### Compliance and recruitment\n\nWe now discuss some potential sources of bias that are peculiar to cluster randomization trials. For example, if the subjects in a trial are newly diagnosed patients and the intervention is some new approach to treating a disease, then it is possible that practitioners in the intervention arm, being newly educated about this disease, may be more likely to diagnose it [8]. This can lead to serious problems of selection bias. Also compliance to treatment may well vary over the participating clusters in a cluster randomized trial (Loeys _et al._[70]). While this will not affect the conclusions of an intent to treat analysis, it has major implications for any attempt at casual modelling. Loeys _et al._[70] demonstrate how to use standard GEE and random effects models to allow for variable compliance among clusters.\n\n### Complex interventions\n\nThe use of cluster randomized trials is now well appreciated in the medical world, and methods for analysis are increasingly becoming available in standard software. The main area of further advance would seem to be in the design and planning of the interventions. These are often _complex_, by which we mean that they depend on a number of interventions. Thus, even a relatively simple study, such as a patient education trial in diabetes raises a number of issues: (i) standardizing what to teach the educators; (ii) training the educators; (iii) deciding how many classes to have; (iv) deciding how many students to allow in each class; and (v) tailoring the education to the needs of the participants. Phase III drug trials are usually preceded by Phase I and Phase II studies in order to decide on issues such as timing and dosage. These are often missing in cluster randomized trials of complex interventions. However, methods of designing complex trials have been described in a set of guidelines produced by the British Medical research Council [71]. These has been criticized on two grounds [72, 73]. First ,the guidelines imply that planning of complex interventions is a linear process, whereas often there is no clear ordering to the respective planning stages. Second, they suggest that one should attempt to standardize the intervention, whereas effective interventions,particularly educational ones, may have to be tailored to the participants. This can lead to problems of understanding exactly what is being tested, which components in an intervention are important, and whether the intervention is replicable.\n\nDue to the large number of possible inter-relations in complex trials, computer modelling is playing an increasing role in the planning of such studies. We expect to see an increasing role played in such pre-trial modelling to decide on the optimum design of the intervention.\n\n## 8 Discussion\n\nThere is now a vast literature on the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials. The level of understanding has increased greatly since the papers published in early volumes of Statistics in Medicine [6, 7, 13, 26]. However, there is still a need for more empirical work to help the user decide which methods might give better results in particular situations.\n\nThis review has, of necessity been partial, and biased towards papers published in _Statistics in Medicine_. However, we feel that many of the key papers have appeared in that journal, and hope that this will continue in the future!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors are grateful to Obi Ukoumunne and Sandra Eldridge for useful comments on a previous draft.

In celebration of 25 years of _Statistics in Medicine_, this paper will review developments in cluster randomized trials, particularly, but not exclusively, those published in the journal.\n\nCluster randomized trials are now a key tool in the evaluation of interventions in health services research. They are widely used and two main types of trial are as follows: (1) interventions that involve training or education of health professionals, with the aim of finding a benefit for patients; (2) community randomized trials where the clusters are complete communities (some authors call these 'large field trials'). These are generally characterized by a relatively small number of clusters each enrolling a large number of subjects. A well-known example of this is the COMMIT smoking intervention trial to be discussed in Section 3.\n\nIt is worth defining a few terms first. The _intraclass correlation (ICC)_ is the ratio of the between cluster variance to the total variance of an outcome variable and is often denoted by \\(\\rho\\). Different designs can lead to different formulas for estimating \\(\\rho\\). The _design effect (DE)_ is the ratio of the variance of an outcome measure when clustering is accounted for to the variance of the outcome measure when clustering is not accounted for. It is often referred to as the _variance inflation factor_, since DE measures the amount that one should increase a variance estimate obtained by ignoring clustering to allow for the clustering effect. For clusters of equal size \\(m\\), it can be shown that \\(\\mbox{DE}\\!=\\!1+(m-1)\\rho\\). Extensions of this formula to the case of variable cluster sizes are given in Section 2.4.\n\nThere have been a number of reviews of cluster randomized trials. In 2001 and in _Statistics in Medicine_, Klar and Donner [2], following on from their book [3] published the previous year, reviewed developments up until that time and suggested areas of further research. These areas included: ethical issues; sample size estimation; analytic issues; economic analysis; meta-analysis of cluster randomized trials and recommendations for trial reporting. The analytic issues included population averaged _versus_ cluster specific (CS) models, methods involving a small number of clusters, issues arising from matched paired designs, overlapping cluster membership, and issues involving missing data. Some related issues were also covered more recently by the same authors [4]. Methodological developments for cluster randomized trials have also been reviewed by Murray _et al._[5]. This paper will update the earlier reviews, in particular the 2001 review in _Statistics in Medicine_.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. Sections 2-4 concern design issues: Section 2 presents issues concerning power and sample size, Section 3 matched pair designs and Section 4 cohort _versus_ cross-sectional designs. In Section 5 we will discuss issues in the analysis of cluster randomized trials. Section 6 describes issues on presentation and reporting and Section 7 deals with some further issues.\n\n## ", "2 Issues arising in the assessment of power and sample size": "\n\n### ", "Number of clusters and number of subjects per cluster": "\n\nOften the number of clusters available to be enrolled in a cluster randomized trial is limited. This has led to considerable interest in developing reliable methods of sample size estimation. Two early papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ reviewed sample size issues in clinical trials in general [6] and particularly in cluster randomized trials [7]. Although values of \\(\\rho\\) in cluster randomized trials tend to be small (typically around 0.05 for primary care trials [8]) and in community randomized trials even smaller (usually less than 0.01 and often near 0.001 [3]) the resulting DE may be very substantial when combined with clusters of large size. Thus, the practice of ignoring clustering effects in the design stage of a trial can lead to an elevated type 2 error, while ignoring it at the analysis stage inevitably leads to an elevated type 1 error.\n\n In cluster randomized trials there are often two sample size choices to be made: the number of clusters and the number of subjects per cluster. A useful rule of thumb is that the power does not increase appreciably once the number of subjects per cluster exceeds \\(1/\\rho\\)[4]. Thus, if it is believed that the ICC is about 0.05 then it is not worth enrolling more than about 20 subjects per cluster. However, if the ICC is near 0.001, which is often typical of community intervention trials, then a sample of 1000 subjects per cluster may be worthwhile, particularly if recruiting new clusters is difficult.\n\nThe sample size formulas we give here assume that data for sample size estimation are obtained from a single sample of clusters from the population of interest, that is the intervention itself has no effect on the cluster size. Examples where this is not true have been given by Campbell [8], and we will return to this topic in Section 7.2.\n\n### ", "Sample sizes for trials involving survival data": "\n\nOne of the earliest (and highest cited) papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ is by Freedman [9] on the sample size required in a study when the outcome is survival. The total number of events, \\(e\\), required for a power \\(\\beta\\) and two-sided significance \\(\\alpha\\) to detect an expected hazard ratio \\(\\theta\\) is given by\n\n\\[e=(z_{\\alpha/2}+z_{\\beta})^{2}\\frac{(1+\\phi\\theta)^{2}}{\\phi(1-\\theta)^{2}}\\] (1)\n\nwhere \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) and \\(z_{\\beta}\\) are the normal ordinates associated with probabilities \\(\\alpha/2\\) and \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\phi\\) is the ratio of the sample size in group 2 to group 1 and \\(\\theta\\) is the expected hazard ratio between groups 2 and 1.\n\nXie and Waksman [10] generalized equation (1) to cluster randomized trials. An important issue in applying this formula is whether one should estimate \\(\\rho\\) from the clustered survival data or, alternatively, from the censoring indicators. Xie and Waksman [10] chose to estimate \\(\\rho\\) from the indicators, since this approach is widely used in the clustered binary data literature. Thus, in what follows \\(\\rho\\) is estimated as a simple correlation of the 0,1's indicating whether or not an event is censored, although further research on this estimation question would be useful. They found that the number of events \\(e_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) required is a simple generalization of Freedman's formula:\n\n\\[e_{\\mathrm{c}}=e(1+(\\overline{m}-1)\\rho)\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\overline{m}=\\sum_{i=1}^{K}m_{i}/K\\), is the average number of subjects per cluster and \\(K\\) is the number of clusters.\n\nThe number of subjects required is then given by\n\n\\[n=\\frac{(1+\\phi)e_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\overline{m}((1-P_{1})+\\phi(1-P_{2}))}\\]\n\nwhere \\(P_{1}\\) and \\(P_{2}\\) are the proportion of individuals with non-events in groups 1 and 2.\n\n### ", "Allowing for imprecision in the ICC": "\n\nMuch of the sample size literature deals with the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates of between-community variation, and hence of \\(\\rho\\), that are needed for sample size planning.\n\n In practice estimates of \\(\\rho\\) for a given outcome variable are usually derived from previously reported studies using similar randomization units. However, these estimates are frequently based on studies which themselves are of small size, and thus their inherent inaccuracy may lend the investigators a false sense of confidence.\n\nUkoumunne [11] has given a series of methods for calculating confidence intervals for the ICC, including an application of the bootstrap. However, it is difficult to know how to use these for planning purposes. As Turner _et al_. [12] have pointed out, for planning purposes it may be better to select a design on the basis of power averaged across uncertainty rather than calculate power from an informally assessed ICC value. Moreover, substitution of a conservative ICC such as the upper value from a 95 per cent confidence interval usually reduces the power for a fixed sample size estimate much more than a method which allows for the imprecision of the ICC. They discuss the use of prior distributions for the ICC and in a Bayesian context show how the uncertainty about this parameter can be expressed in the form of a parametric distribution which naturally leads to a distribution of projected power for any particular design. This Bayesian approach towards the determination of sample size could then be followed by a statistical analysis within the traditional frequentist framework. Turner _et al_. [12] showed that increasing the number of clusters enables the total sample size to be reduced for a given power. With a given number of subjects estimated from an unclustered design, increasing the number of clusters also considerably reduces the lower limit of the posterior distribution of power. In other words, uncertainty in the ICC will produce uncertainty in the actual power of a study, but a design based on a greater number of clusters has less chance of having a very low power.\n\nAn alternative approach to dealing with uncertainty in observed values of \\(\\rho\\) is described by Feng and Grizzle [13], who proposed the use of a method similar in principle to the bootstrap procedure. Their approach requires the simulation of results of studies of the same size that yielded the observed estimate. One then can substitute the values of \\(\\rho\\) obtained from each simulation into the appropriate sample size formula to generate a distribution of projected powers, followed by the selection of a point on this distribution, e.g. the 90th percentile, that reflects the degree of conservativeness desired.\n\n### ", "Allowing for varying cluster sizes": "\n\nVariation in cluster size is another source of imprecision and Kerry and Bland [14] following Donner _et al_. [15] suggest using\n\n\\[\\mathrm{DE}=1+(m_{a}-1)\\rho\\quad\\mathrm{where}\\ m_{a}=\\sum m_{i}^{2}/\\sum m_{i}\\] (2)\n\nThe problem of using this formula is that the individual cluster sizes must be known prior to conducting the trial.\n\nEldridge _et al_. [16] modified (2) to give\n\n\\[\\mathrm{DE}=1+\\left(\\left(\\mathrm{cv}^{2}\\frac{(k-1)}{k}+1\\right)\\overline{m }-1\\right)\\rho\\] (3)\n\nwhere \\(\\mathrm{cv}=s_{m}/\\overline{m}\\) and \\(s_{m}\\) is the s.d. of the cluster size. They suggest that formula (3) is more practical than (2) since the value of \\(\\mathrm{cv}\\) (coefficient of variation) may often be known in advance. Eldridge _et al_. [16] also provide some examples of the coefficient of variation for sample sizes typically seen in cluster randomized trials. A further issue is that the estimated ICC will have sampling variation. Eldridge _et al_. [16] give an empirical correction for the DE in this case.\n\n This formula is appropriate for cluster level analyses that weight by cluster size. For the much more common GEE analysis, which we describe in Section 5, this formula is likely to be conservative.\n\n### ", "Sample size re-estimation": "\n\nWhen prior knowledge of the value of the variance components required to ascertain the sample size is unavailable, we can undertake an internal pilot study to provide these estimates, using a well cited paper in this area by Wittes and Brittain [17], and as extended to cluster randomized trials by Lake _et al._[18]. With this approach, several nuisance parameters, including \\(\\rho\\), the mean cluster size and measures of cluster size variation, are estimated at an interim point in the study, followed by re-estimation of the final required trial size. Although this procedure is most suited to trials that randomize a relatively large number of clusters, such as families or households, over an extended period of time, Lake _et al._[18] point out that it could also be applied to at least some community intervention trials provided the participating clusters are recruited prospectively. Turner _et al._[12] state that imprecision in the estimate of \\(\\rho\\) is not accounted for in this application, but their own method could easily be extended to do so. More experience on the application of internal pilot studies to such trials is clearly needed.\n\n### ", "Empirical investigations of design effects": "\n\nEmpirical investigations of design effects likely to arise in cluster randomized trials implemented in a specific setting are also helpful to investigators. An example of such an investigation is given by Mickey _et al._[19], who presented design effects from a trial designed to intervene on breast cancer mortality. Ukoumunne _et al._[20] presented variance components for some common outcomes, as did Gulliford _et al._[21].\n\nSeveral authors have shown that adjusting for covariates either at the community or individual-level can improve the power of a trial by reducing the magnitude of the between-cluster variation [8, 22]. Additional gains in power may be realized by modelling individual level covariates (e.g. age) and also at the cluster level (e.g. mean cluster age) as described by Klar and Darlington [23].\n\n## ", "3 Issues in the design and analysis of matched pair community randomized trials": "\n\n### ", "Design of matched pair studies": "\n\nMatched pair studies are not frequently seen in clinical trials randomizing individual subjects to different intervention groups. However, they have proved to be the design of choice for many investigators embarking on a community intervention trial, largely because of the perceived ability of this design to create intervention groups that are comparable at baseline with respect to important prognostic factors, including, for example, community size and geographic area. The relatively small number of communities that can be enrolled in such studies further enhances the attractiveness of pair matching as a method of reducing the probability of substantively important imbalances that may detract from the credibility of the reported results. _Statistics in Medicine_ has been the forum for much of the debate surrounding the advantages and disadvantages of this design.\n\n Freedman _et al_. [24] were among the first authors to investigate the gain in efficiency obtained from matching in a community intervention trial. This was done in the context of COMMIT (Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation), a community programme designed to encourage citizens to stop smoking. As discussed by Gail _et al_. [25], 11 pairs of communities were matched on the basis of several factors expected to be related to the smoking quit rates, such as community size, geographical proximity and demographic profile. Within each matched pair, one community was allocated at random to the intervention group, with the other acting as the control. It is also interesting to note that this trial was one of the first large-scale community intervention studies to use formal power considerations at the planning stage, and, perhaps not coincidentally, to be substantially larger in size than its predecessors.\n\nAssuming the gain in efficiency due to matching may be quantified by the factor \\(G=1/(1-\\rho_{m})\\), where \\(\\rho_{m}\\) is the correlation between members of a pair with respect to the outcome variable, Freedman _et al_. [24] showed that matching can lead to considerable gains in statistical precision when it is based on an effective surrogate for outcome. However, since \\(G\\) is simply the ratio of population variances ignoring or accounting for pair-matching, it does not take into account the difference in degrees of freedom for estimating these variances, a factor which is particularly relevant in trials enrolling a small number of communities. For example, in the COMMIT study, the degrees of freedom available for estimating error from the paired differences in event rates would be only 10, as compared to the 20 degrees of freedom available for an unmatched analysis.\n\nThis issue was subsequently addressed in detail by Martin _et al_. [26], who evaluated the relative efficiency of a matched to an unmatched analysis by using percentiles of the non-central \\(t\\)-distribution to account for the differences in degrees of freedom. On the basis of these results they concluded that for studies having no more than 20 pairs, matching should be used for the purpose of increasing power only if the investigators are confident that \\(\\rho_{m}\\) exceeds 0.20. By considering the practical difficulties that often arise in securing 'good' matches, they also concluded more generally that 'matching may be overused as a design tool' in community intervention trials.\n\nThese considerations suggest that a tempting strategy in practice may be to perform an unmatched analysis of data arising from a matched pair design, particularly when matching is adopted mainly for the purpose of avoiding a 'bad' randomization. The effectiveness of such a strategy was investigated by Diehr _et al_. [27], who concluded on the basis of an extensive simulation study that breaking the matches can actually result in an increase in power when the number of pairs is less than ten. Thus, the loss in precision identified by Martin _et al_. [26] in the presence of weak matching correlations can be at least partially regained.\n\nA secondary objective of many community intervention trials is to investigate the effect of individual-level risk factors on one or more outcome variables. Focusing on the case of a continuous outcome variable, Donner _et al_. [28] showed that the practice of performing an unmatched analysis on data arising from a pair-matched design can lead to bias in the estimated regression coefficient, and a corresponding test of significance which is overly liberal. However, for large-scale community intervention trials, which typically recruit a relatively small number of large clusters, such an analysis will generally be both valid and efficient.\n\nPerhaps the most commonly adopted matching factors in large-scale community randomized trials have been cluster size and geographic area (e.g. urban _versus_ rural). Matching by cluster size is attractive not only because it protects against large imbalances in the number of subjects per intervention group, an efficiency consideration, but also because cluster size may be associated with other important but unaccounted for baseline variables, such as socioeconomic status and access to health care resources (Lewsey [29]). Matching by categorized levels of baseline versions of the trial outcome rate would also seem attractive. However, results reported by Feng _et al_. [22] suggest that if primary interest is changed from the baseline, such matching is not likely to add benefits in power beyond that yielded by an analysis of change scores.\n\n### ", "Limitations of matched pair designs": "\n\nKlar and Donner [30] explored some further limitations of the matched pair designs that are more general in nature. These limitations arise largely from the total confounding of the intervention effect with the natural variation that exists between two members of a matched pair. One consequence of such confounding is that it precludes the use of standard methods for estimating the underlying ICC, which in turn reduces analytic flexibility. For example, a secondary objective of many studies is to estimate the effect of selected individual level risk factors on one or more outcome variables using regression modelling. However, the calculation of appropriate standard errors for the regression coefficients obtained from such a model requires a valid estimator of \\(\\rho\\). Thus, although it is possible to perform adjustments for the effect of such risk factors using a two-stage residualized approach e.g. Gail _et al_. [31], the task of testing for their independent relationship with outcome is more difficult (Donner _et al_. [28]). Moreover the matched pair design frequently does not bring large gains in precision. This led Klar and Donner [30] to recommend that greater attention be paid to the possibility of adopting a stratified design, in which two or more clusters are randomized to each intervention group within the strata. This design may be particularly attractive when investigators find it challenging to create matched pairs that correspond to unique estimates of risk for each pair. Most importantly, the cluster level replication inherent in this less rigid allocation scheme removes many of the analytic limitations associated with pair-matching, while increasing the degrees of freedom available for estimating error.\n\n## ", "4 Other design issues": "\n\n### ", "Cohort versus cross-sectional designs": "\n\nMany community intervention trials are longitudinal in nature, allowing a choice between a cohort design and a cross-sectional design. For a cohort design, clusters are randomly assigned to intervention groups, with or without stratification. Cohorts sampled from each cluster are then measured over two or more time points, with at least the first measurement occurring before randomization. The cross-sectional design is similar, except that samples are selected independently within each cluster at each time point. Because responses within the same subject often have a strong positive correlation, the cohort design is theoretically more efficient.\n\nFeldman and McKinlay [32] presented a unified statistical model that embraces both designs as special cases, thus allowing an assessment of how the values of different design parameters affect their relative precision. A principal conclusion from their investigation was that cohort designs have unique disadvantages that may outweigh any advantage in theoretical efficiency. The first of these is related to possible instability in cohorts of large size, with the resulting likelihood of subject loss to follow-up. Although this disadvantage can be compensated for by oversampling at baseline, this might well negate the original reasons for adopting a cohort design. Differential loss to follow-up by intervention group also creates the risk of bias.\n\nThe second disadvantage is related to the issue of representativeness of the target population, which is invariably hampered by the ageing of the cohort over time. Assuming that changes related to the ageing process are independent of the intervention assignment, this effect will not invalidate the principal comparison of interest. However, it does imply that a difference observed in a cohort trial with respect to a given outcome variable cannot be directly compared to the corresponding difference between observed cross-sectional samples. Thus, if the primary questions of interest focus on change at the community level rather than at the level of the individual, cohort samples are the less natural choice. This point is discussed by others [33, 34], who describe and compare several approaches that might be taken to the analysis of repeated cross-sectional samples. Additional discussion is provided by Murray _et al_. [35].\n\n### ", "Practical design issues": "\n\nThere are two useful papers in _Statistics in Medicine_ that look at practical issues for the conduct of cluster randomized trials. Flynn _et al_. [36] address the issue of whether it is worth recruiting an extra cluster or to recruit more individuals to existing clusters. They show how the use of contour graphs of power by number of clusters per treatment arm and cluster size can be usefully exploited. Moerbeek [37] suggests that often a cheaper strategy than recruiting another cluster would be to measure additional covariates related to the outcome, in order to reduce the variance. This, of course, requires the cost of measuring the covariate to be relatively small and the correlation of the covariate and the outcome to be reasonably high.\n\n## ", "5 Issues in the analysis of cluster randomized trials": "\n\n### ", "Cluster specific versus marginal models": "\n\nConsider an outcome variable \\(Y\\) (which may be continuous or binary), with expected value \\(\\mu\\) and a generalized link of the form\n\n\\[g(\\mu)=\\eta=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X+Z\\] (4)\n\nwhere the function \\(g\\) is assumed strictly monotone and differentiable. We further assume that \\(Z\\) is a random variable \\(E(Z)=0\\) and \\(\\operatorname{var}(Z)=\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\) and so is independent of the fixed effect \\(X\\).\n\nEquation (4) may be a suitable model for clustered data. We assume that the clusters are sampled from a larger population and the effect of any particular cluster \\(i\\) is to add a random effect \\(Z_{i}\\) to all the outcomes. For a cluster randomized we could set \\(X=1\\) for intervention and \\(X=0\\) for control. A CS model measures the effect on \\(Y\\) of changing \\(X\\), while \\(Z\\) is held constant. This is a common model for longitudinal data, where it is possible to imagine, say in a cross-over trial, a treatment value changing over time. However, in a cluster randomized, everyone in a cluster receives the same treatment, and although a CS model can be fitted, the result can be interpreted only theoretically. The alternative is to fit a model which looks at the average effect of \\(X\\) over the range of \\(Z\\). This is the so-called _population averaged_ (\\(PA\\)) or _marginal_ model.\n\nConsider a model where we fit only \\(X\\), so that\n\n\\[\\eta=\\beta_{0}^{*}+\\beta_{1}^{*}X\\] (5)\n\nFitting model (5) is equivalent to fitting a PA model, that is we estimate the effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) as averaged over all the clusters \\(Z\\).\n\nNeuhaus and Jewell [38] approach the contrast between CS models and PA models by observing that model (5) is simply model (4) with the variable \\(Z\\) omitted. If we assume that the coefficients for \\(X\\) in the two models are related by \\(\\beta_{1}^{*}\\approx B\\,\\beta\\), where \\(B\\) is the bias factor, then they show that for a linear model \\(B=1\\), and so the interpretation of CS and marginal models is the same. However, for a logistic link, \\(\\mu=\\log\\)it(\\(P\\,(Y=1\\,|\\,X,\\,Z)\\) is a random variable and\n\n\\[B=1-\\frac{\\sigma_{z}^{2}}{E(\\mu)\\{1-E(\\mu)\\}}=1-\\rho\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the correlation of the \\(Y\\)'s within clusters assuming \\(\\beta_{1}=0\\). Since, as discussed earlier, the value of \\(\\rho\\) in community randomized trials is usually less than 0.01, this suggests that the bias in incorrectly assuming a marginal model should not be great.\n\nIn this case 0\\(<\\)\\(B<\\)1, so the general effect of using a PA model is to attenuate the regression coefficient. One can also see that for a logistic link the greater the variability of the random variable \\(Z\\), and so the greater the intracluster correlation, the greater the attenuation.\n\nNeuhaus and Jewell [38] also show that \\(B=1\\) for a log link, which would suggest that in prospective studies such as clinical trials it would be advantageous to use a log-linear model which estimates the relative risk rather than a logistic model for odds ratios. Until recently the software for accurately estimating the standard errors of the estimates for cluster log-linear models was not available, but Zou [39] has recently demonstrated how it can be done using Poisson regression and robust standard errors.\n\nThe fact that log-linear models estimate the same population parameter for CS and marginal models does not appear well known. For example Murray _et al._[5] state that 'in the case of binary data the coefficient from a marginal model is smaller than that from a conditional model...'.\n\n### ", "Inflating the standard error": "\n\nFor a linear model we write\n\n\\[y_{ij}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+Z_{i}+\\varepsilon_{ij}\\] (6)\n\nwhere \\(y_{ij}\\) is the outcome of the \\(j\\)th subject (\\(j=1,\\ldots,\\,K\\)) in the \\(i\\)th cluster (\\(i=1,\\ldots,\\,m_{j}\\)), and we assume \\(E(\\varepsilon_{ij})=E(Z_{i})=0\\), \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) and \\(Z_{i}\\) are independent, \\(V(\\varepsilon_{ij})=\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(V(Z_{i})=\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Here \\(X_{i}\\) is an intervention indicator variable (\\(0\\), \\(1\\)) which depends only on the cluster. An _exchangeable_ correlation structure is assumed, which effectively means that one can exchange subjects \\(j\\) and \\(j^{\\prime}\\) within a cluster without changing the covariance. This breaks down if the subjects are measured more than once (for example, at baseline and at follow-up) since the correlation of the same subject measured twice will not be the same as the correlation of two different subjects within a cluster. It also means that the ICC must be assumed to be the same within each arm of the trial, an assumption which is guaranteed in a randomized trial under the null hypothesis of no intervention effect.\n\nWe can rewrite (6) as\n\n\\[y_{ij}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+\\eta_{ij}\\] (7)\n\nwhere the \\(\\eta_{ij}\\) are random errors which are not independent, but are typically assumed to have an exchangeable structure defined by the clusters. This is the PA model described in Section 5.1.\n\nWe can fit model (7) but not account for the correlated nature of the errors terms. Provided that \\(Z_{i}\\) is uncorrelated with \\(X_{i}\\) then we get a valid estimate of the treatment effect but the standard error of the treatment effect is underestimated, and should be inflated. A technique originating in sample survey research is to simply multiply the standard error by the DE. For example, the DE given in Section 1 may be estimated by replacing the ICC with its sample estimate [3]. A simple test of whether a parameter is zero, known as a modified Wald test, is to divide an estimate of the parameter by its modified standard error which is then compared to a standard normal distribution. Donner and Klar [3] give a number of methods for continuous and binary outcomes which modify the standard error associated with either the \\(t\\)-test or the chi-squared test, respectively. It is important to note that the estimate of the treatment effect is unchanged, only the standard error is inflated. An alternative method is to use the so-called 'sandwich' or Huber-White estimator which has a long history in econometrics for estimators with continuous data and with heterogeneous variances. This fits a model where the variance of the error term \\(V(\\eta)=\\sigma_{i}^{2}\\) is not assumed constant, and is estimated through the residuals of the model. The advantage of the robust standard error is that one does not need to estimate the ICC separately before conducting the analysis. The disadvantage is that it may be less efficient and so would need a greater number of clusters than does use of the model-dependent standard error. The use of robust standard errors for cluster randomized trials was first suggested by Brook _et al._[40], and implemented in a number of statistical packages, for example in _Stata_ by Rogers [41].\n\nIn general, Donner and Klar's [3] methods which adjust the standard error give an estimate of the treatment effect which, in effect, weights each cluster by the size of the cluster, so that larger clusters have greater weight. An alternative is to use the method of summary measures, as popularized by Matthews _et al._[42]. This gives equal weight to each cluster, irrespective of size and is a CS method. This approach has a great deal to recommend it since it simply uses the summary statistics (mean or proportion) for each cluster and is easy to apply without specialist software. However, one cannot adjust for individual level covariates directly using this approach.\n\n### ", "Fitting models to data": "\n\nThe generalized estimating equation (GEE) method, developed by Liang and Zeger [43] in the context of longitudinal studies, has proved to very popular for the analysis of data arising from cluster randomized trials. It fits the PA model and uses an iteratively reweighting algorithm to estimate the parameters and a robust method for the standard error. Use of the GEE is a 'shrinkage' approach which is a compromise between no weighting and weighting by the sample size. Assuming an exchangeable correlation structure, it effectively weights each mean by \\(m_{i}/(m_{i}\\sigma_{z}^{2}+\\sigma^{2})\\), which weights the means by the sample size when \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}=0\\) and gives equal weight when \\(\\sigma^{2}=0\\). In practice, estimates of the variance components are used.\n\nThe analysis of continuous data is relatively straightforward and a comparison of maximum likelihood assuming a normal mixed model, GEE, a bootstrap and a '4-stage method' have been given by Feng _et al._[44]. The bootstrap used by Feng _et al._ draws a random sample of size \\(K\\) from the original \\(K\\) clusters. Then one can use ordinary least squares to estimate the \\(\\beta\\)'s and repeat a large number of times. The four stage method is non-iterative, where the first step is to estimate the \\(\\beta\\)'s by ordinary least squares and obtain the residuals \\(e_{i}=Y_{i}-X_{i}\\widehat{\\beta}\\). Then the \\(e_{i}\\)'s are regressed against the \\(Z_{i}\\)'s, leading to estimates of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). One can then use these estimates in a weighted least squares regression of \\(Y_{i}\\)_versus_\\(X_{i}\\).\n\nFor small numbers of clusters (\\(<\\)10 per arm) and for near balanced data the bootstrap has been shown to do well, especially if one does not wish to assume normality. For larger numbers of clusters, the maximum likelihood method performed better than GEE.\n\nGEE is used widely for hypothesis testing and confidence interval construction because it can control for the influence of potential confounders on outcome without the need to specify an underlying distribution for the sample observations. The robust variance estimation relies on between-cluster information to assure the validity of the resulting inferences. It is therefore important to be wary of this approach to community intervention trials, where the amount of such information tends to be relatively small.\n\nFeng _et al_. [44] recommended for continuous data that GEE should not be applied to trials having 20 or fewer communities. Recent research has shown that for studies enrolling few clusters one should take account of the fact that the observed residuals, which are used in robust estimation, are biased estimates of the error variable, because of the requirement that they sum to zero. This bias can be removed by dividing the squared error by the diagonal of the 'hat' matrix. It has also been found that using a \\(t\\)-distribution (or a Satterthwaite type degrees of freedom correction) and a jack-knife improves the estimate of the standard error [45, 46, 47]. Pan and Wall [47] proposed replacing the GEE Wald test by approximate \\(t\\)- or \\(F\\)-tests. Although the proposed procedures showed type 1 errors closer to nominal than the usual Wald test, they were shown to be strictly applicable only in clusters of small sizes. It is therefore clear that more research is needed on the development of adjusted GEE procedures that can be applied to clusters of the size that typically arise in community intervention trials.\n\nRecently Guo _et al_. [48] discussed not only the use of a robust standard error in the Wald test, but also the robust score test, particularly for cluster randomized trials. They show that the use of the Wald test is too liberal (more likely to give a significant value) and the score test is too conservative and suggest that a simple correction \\(K/(K-1)\\) to the score statistic will give a test size closer to the nominal value.\n\nIt is worth commenting that the use of the sandwich estimator has been associated with the GEE method so many times that they may appear synonymous. In fact they are not, and one can use robust standard error without GEE as described in Section 5.2.\n\n### ", "Analysis of binary data": "\n\nAs discussed in Section 5.1 binary models can estimate different population parameters and so deserve special consideration.\n\nLet \\(Y_{ij}\\) (0 or 1) be the \\(j\\)th observation (\\(j=1,\\,\\ldots,\\,m_{i}\\)) in the \\(i\\)th cluster (\\(i=1,\\,2,\\,\\ldots,\\,K\\)). The intervention variable is \\(X_{i}\\) (0 or 1). The CS logistic model is\n\n\\[\\log it\\,(\\pi_{ij})=\\beta_{0}+\\beta X_{i}+Z_{i}\\] (8)\n\nwhere \\(Z_{i}\\) is the effect of being in cluster \\(i\\) and where \\(\\pi_{ij}=E(Y_{ij}|X_{i},\\,Z_{i})\\). This model can be extended to include individual specific covariates \\(X_{ij}\\). The random variable \\(Z_{i}\\) is assumed independent of \\(X_{i}\\) and is usually assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Given the \\(Z_{i}\\), the \\(Y_{ij}\\)'s are assumed independently distributed with binomial parameter \\(\\pi_{ij}\\).\n\nRecently Heo and Leon [49] compared different methods of analysis under (8): (i) full likelihood; (ii) penalized quasi-likelihood; (iii) GEE and (iv) fixed effects logistic regression. The third method is a marginal method which, following the discussion in Section 5.1, estimates a different population parameter than the regression coefficient in (8). However, it does not require one to assume a normal distribution for the \\(Z_{i}\\). The last method does not take the ICC into account, and is an invalid method in general for cluster randomized trials. However if \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}=0\\) it may be expected to yield valid tests and efficient estimates.\n\n The full likelihood \\(L\\) is given by\n\n\\[L=\\prod_{i=1}^{K}\\int\\prod_{j=1}^{m_{i}}\\mu_{ij}(\\beta,\\,Z_{i})^{y_{ij}}\\{1-\\mu_{ ij}(\\beta,\\,Z_{i})\\}^{1-y_{ij}}\\,f\\,(Z_{i};\\,\\sigma^{2})\\,\\mathrm{d}Z_{i}\\] (9)\n\nwhere \\(f(.)\\) is the normal distribution function.\n\nEquation (9) can be maximized using Gaussian quadrature or other numerical methods to obtain estimates of the regression coefficients.\n\nPenalized quasi-likelihood is a method of maximizing the likelihood whilst avoiding the integration, using a Laplace method for approximating the integral (Breslow and Clayton [50]).\n\nHeo and Leon [49] found that the full likelihood method and the penalized likelihood methods to be similar and no worse than the fixed effects method even when the within-cluster correlations are zero. As expected the GEE method gave biased estimates of \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{cs}}\\). They did not investigate the effects of estimating \\(\\beta_{\\mathrm{PA}}\\).\n\nPreisser _et al_. [51] showed how to apply a PA model to a pre-test post-test cross-sectional design, where the assumption of an exchangeable correlation matrix breaks down. They state that the GEE approach is asymptotically equivalent to the summary measure approach, and quote Mancl and De Rouen [46] to the effect that using bias-corrected variances can yield valid test sizes even with unequal cluster sizes and with as few as 10 clusters.\n\n### ", "Bayesian methods": "\n\nThe likelihood given in (9) requires numerical integration to solve. An alternative method is to use simulation via Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms. These are normally associated with a Bayesian analysis, but choice of suitable non-informative priors will yield results similar to the conventional likelihood methods.\n\nSpiegelhalter [52] described the method for the Bayesian analysis of cluster randomized trials with a continuous response. This was extended to a binary outcome by Turner _et al_. [53].\n\nThey used model (8) and looked at different prior distributions for \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\). Since \\(\\sigma_{Z}^{2}\\) is closely related to the ICC, they argued that often it is more appropriate to use a prior distribution on the ICC, since prior information on the ICC is now becoming available [21, 22]. They experimented with different prior distributions and showed that the estimate of the treatment effect is not entirely robust to the distributional assumptions of the model, and suggested caution in using the conventional normality assumption. They contrasted their results to an earlier study by Omar and Thompson [54] who used a multilevel model and a penalized quasi-likelihood procedure to obtain the estimates. Turner _et al_. [53] showed that the variance components tend to be underestimated when using the non-Bayesian approach.\n\nThompson _et al_. [55] argue that often in a clinical trial one is interested in a risk difference rather than an odds ratio, and describe how to carry out a Bayesian analysis in such a situation.\n\n### ", "Modelling in matched pairs designs": "\n\nThompson _et al_. [56] replaced standard modelling approaches by techniques borrowed from meta-analysis. Thus, an intervention/control pair replaces an individual clinical trial of a meta-analysis. This is essentially equivalent to relying on between-stratum information to estimate \\(\\rho\\) under the assumption of no intervention by stratum interaction. An attractive feature of this is that the forest plot can show which pairs appear to be outliers. However, this approach requires a large number of strata (pairs) to ensure its validity, and is therefore not applicable to many community intervention studies.\n\nThe meta-analysis method as applied to the matched pairs design was extended to binary data by Alexander and Emerson [57] using a Bayesian approach. Their technique was illustrated by applying it to incidence rates of trachoma in Africa. Methods that may be applied to data arising from a stratified cluster randomized design are discussed by Dobbins and Simpson [58] and Song and Ahn [59]. However, they restrict themselves to a comparison of the performance of specific tests in terms of the size and power, rather than on the general problem of estimation.\n\nThe strict lack of applicability of the \\(t\\)-test to binary outcomes in a matched pair design has led some investigators to alternatively recommend non-parametric approaches, such as Fisher's one sample randomization (permutation) test. Simulations performed by Gail _et al._[31] showed that inferences for matched pair binary data using permutation procedures will have significance levels near nominal under conditions likely to arise in community intervention trials. Essentially, the same conclusions were reached by Brookmeyer and Chen [60] for person-time data arising from matched pair trials. It is useful to note, however, that the one sample permutation test requires a minimum of six pairs to yield a two-sided \\(p\\)-value of less than 0.05, reflecting its relatively weak power. Donner and Donald [61] showed that a weighted paired \\(t\\)-test based on a logistic transformation of the crude event rates tends to be more powerful than both the permutation test and the standard paired \\(t\\)-test in trials having a small number of strata.\n\n## ", "6 Presenting data": "\n\n### ", "CONSORT statement": "\n\nIt is a perennial complaint amongst analysts that cluster randomized trials are poorly reported [62]. The original CONSORT statement was an attempt to improve reporting of individually randomized trials. This statement was subsequently adapted for cluster randomized trials, published in _Statistics in Medicine_[63], and has been well cited. It has now been revised and published in a medical journal [64, 65]. The most important distinctions from the original are: (i) to give a rationale for adopting a cluster design; (ii) to describe how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the sample size calculations; (iii) to describe how the effects of clustering were incorporated into the analysis; and (iv) to describe the flow of both clusters and participants through the trial, from assignment to analysis. Thus, in a primary care trial, for example, one would like to know how many primary care groups were approached, how many agreed to participate, how many were randomized, and how many dropped out during the trial, as well as the characteristics of the patients in the study. The most up-to-date statement is available at www.consort-statement.org\n\n### ", "Improvements in reporting": "\n\nA recent review by Bland [66] contrasted the years 1983, 88, 93, 98 and 2003. He suggests that cluster randomized trials are becoming more prevalent and the presentation of cluster randomized trials has improved, particularly after 1998. He suggests that statistical pressure has contributed to this and it is of note that the two seminal books were published in that period [3, 67].\n\n \n\n## ", "7 Other Considerations": "\n\n### ", "Clustering by practitioner": "\n\nInvestigators may need to contend with clustering of subjects' responses even for trials using individual randomization. For example, patients may be randomized as they enter a trial by whether or not they will receive a new intervention (say acupuncture). However, there may be a limited number of acupuncturists and so a single acupuncturist may treat a number of patients. The outcomes will thus be affected not only by whether the patient received acupuncture but by which acupuncturist.\n\nThe model is\n\n\\[y_{ijk}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X_{i}+\\gamma Z_{k}+\\varepsilon_{ij}\\]\n\nwhere the subscript \\(k\\) indicates the effect of different acupuncturists and \\(Z_{k}=0\\) for the control group. However, it is important to note that the subjects in the control group are not naturally clustered. Issues in the analysis of these trials have been covered by Roberts and Roberts [68]. Lee and Thompson [69] discuss a Bayesian approach to the analysis of such trials, and point out that taking into account clustering in the analysis can affect the results.\n\n### ", "Compliance and recruitment": "\n\nWe now discuss some potential sources of bias that are peculiar to cluster randomization trials. For example, if the subjects in a trial are newly diagnosed patients and the intervention is some new approach to treating a disease, then it is possible that practitioners in the intervention arm, being newly educated about this disease, may be more likely to diagnose it [8]. This can lead to serious problems of selection bias. Also compliance to treatment may well vary over the participating clusters in a cluster randomized trial (Loeys _et al._[70]). While this will not affect the conclusions of an intent to treat analysis, it has major implications for any attempt at casual modelling. Loeys _et al._[70] demonstrate how to use standard GEE and random effects models to allow for variable compliance among clusters.\n\n### ", "Complex interventions": "\n\nThe use of cluster randomized trials is now well appreciated in the medical world, and methods for analysis are increasingly becoming available in standard software. The main area of further advance would seem to be in the design and planning of the interventions. These are often _complex_, by which we mean that they depend on a number of interventions. Thus, even a relatively simple study, such as a patient education trial in diabetes raises a number of issues: (i) standardizing what to teach the educators; (ii) training the educators; (iii) deciding how many classes to have; (iv) deciding how many students to allow in each class; and (v) tailoring the education to the needs of the participants. Phase III drug trials are usually preceded by Phase I and Phase II studies in order to decide on issues such as timing and dosage. These are often missing in cluster randomized trials of complex interventions. However, methods of designing complex trials have been described in a set of guidelines produced by the British Medical research Council [71]. These has been criticized on two grounds [72, 73]. First ,the guidelines imply that planning of complex interventions is a linear process, whereas often there is no clear ordering to the respective planning stages. Second, they suggest that one should attempt to standardize the intervention, whereas effective interventions,particularly educational ones, may have to be tailored to the participants. This can lead to problems of understanding exactly what is being tested, which components in an intervention are important, and whether the intervention is replicable.\n\nDue to the large number of possible inter-relations in complex trials, computer modelling is playing an increasing role in the planning of such studies. We expect to see an increasing role played in such pre-trial modelling to decide on the optimum design of the intervention.\n\n## ", "8 Discussion": "\n\nThere is now a vast literature on the design and analysis of cluster randomized trials. The level of understanding has increased greatly since the papers published in early volumes of Statistics in Medicine [6, 7, 13, 26]. However, there is still a need for more empirical work to help the user decide which methods might give better results in particular situations.\n\nThis review has, of necessity been partial, and biased towards papers published in _Statistics in Medicine_.

Russo\n\nDomenico Cucinotta\n\n###### Abstract\n\nConsidering other pharmacological approaches, also in the field of insulin therapy, the use of biosimilar drugs instead of originators could help to reduce the worldwide increasing costs of its related disease, that is, diabetes mellitus (DM), and the subsequent risk of insulin underutilization. Available evidences clearly demonstrate that biosimilar efficacy and safety are superimposable to those of the originator insulin with lower expenditure; despite this, however, their underutilization persists both in Eastern and in Western countries. Specific, regional activities are needed in order to improve biosimilar insulin use and to contribute to a substantial reduction of the costs of DM.\n\nBiosimilar insulin, Diabetes mellitus, Insulin costs +\nFootnote \u2020: journal: Computer Science\n\n**Accepted**: January 29, 2024\n\n**Published online**: February 9, 2024\n\n**Corresponding author:**\n\nProf. Domenico Cucinotta\n\ndomeniccucinotta888@gmail.com\n\nA AboutOpen - ISSN 2465-2628 - www.dobotcharacteristics, some modifications were made to the original human molecule in order to obtain more rapid-acting products for prandial needs and more stable and prolonged drugs for basal insulinization; they were called insulin analogs. Actually, three different short-acting (Lispro, Aspart, and Gulisine), one ultrafast-acting (FiAsp), and four long-acting (Glargine U100, Detemt, Glargine U300, and Degludec) insulin analogs are available on the market, together with the recombinant human insulin (6).\n\nThe improved pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin analogs, in comparison with human insulins, did not result in a better metabolic control as expressed by hemoglobin AIC (HbAlc1) levels, but it reduced the risk of the most worrying complication of insulin therapy, that is, hypoglycemia, with lower blood glucose variability, and this explains why their use has rapidly increased in all the countries where they are available. Analogs, however, are even more expensive than human insulins; in the Italian market the price of analogs is two to three times greater than that of human insulins and the same usually happens in the international market (7). The global insulin market size was valued at $18.73 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow from $18.95 billion in 2023 to $21.04 billion by 2030. It has registered a 5% decline during the pandemic year 2020, with a subsequent sharp increase in the following years 2021 and 2022 (7). Almost three-fourths of this market is represented by insulin analogs (8).\n\nTaken together, both the increasing number of subjects treated with insulin and the growing prices of the drug explain what, especially in Western countries, has been claimed as the \"Insulin Crisis,\" that is, a progressive and poorly sustainable escalation of the costs that national health systems pay for insulin or, in the case of private insurance companies as in the United States, a reduced coverage for this expenditure. In this latter case many patients autonomously reduce the daily insulin dose to save money, with catastrophic consequences in terms of quality and outcomes of diabetes care (7).\n\n### Biosimilars\n\nIn the field of chemical drugs a valid cost-saving instrument has been the substitution of the branded products with the so-called \"generic\" ones, when the patent of the originator drug expires. The same can also be done in the field of biological drugs, as insulin analogs are, obtaining what are known as \"biosimilars\" (9). There are, however, some important differences between generic drugs, which usually are small chemical molecules with standard and predictable efficacy, and biosimilars, whose structure is much more complex and whose production is much more expensive. Since biosimilars are designed to match the structure, function, and clinical effects of an already licensed reference biological product, a head-to-head comparison with the reference/originator biologic drug and other quality attributes is required to demonstrate the biosimilarity of the proposed drug. Also, once demonstrated, the comparable analytical characterization and similarity of the biosimilar with originator needs to be followed by clinical evaluation and this requires specific clinical trials (10) (Fig. 1). Consequently, the biosimilar price is not so lower than that of the originator as it happens with the generic drugs; however, an approximately 25%-30% cost saving is common. If applied to the global insulin market, this could theoretically lead to about a $4 billion saving\n\nGlargine U100 was the first insulin analog that lost its patent protection in 2015, followed in recent years by the rapid-acting analogs Lispro and Aspart; for all these insuimlars are today available in the international market. Despite this, and despite the evidence of similar efficacy and safety with analogs (11), the biosimilar insulin market does not grow as it happened with the generic drugs or with other biosimilars. In England it has been estimated that from 2015 to 2018 the use of Glargine biosimilar generated only a minimal part (3.42%) of the potential savings (12).\n\nIn Italy biosimilars account for <20% of the total expenditure for insulins and there is no evidence of increase: from January 2022 to May 2023 this percentage has been substantially stable (13) (Fig. 2). In a large international survey concerning the utilization of long-acting insulin analogs and their biosimilar in some Asian countries, it has been shown that there is an increasing use of long-acting insulin analogs across all countries, while that of long-acting biosimilar insulins is very different: it is high in countries such as\n\nFigure 1: Biosimilar development steps (from Joshia et al (10)).\n\n Banglades, India, and Malaysia where they are produced, but it is low in other regions (Japan, Korea), perhaps because of the reduced price gain and the lack of local promotional activities. Accordingly, they suggest that implementation of these activities, both local production and stakeholder awareness, can help increase their use and the related beneficial effects (14).\n\n## Biosimilars and the \"insulin crisis\"\n\nAs a general rule, biosimilars are more expensive than generic drugs, because of the complexity of their molecules, the need for specific and highly qualified manufacturing skills, and even the small differences with the originator that require new clinical trials and revisions from local regulatory authorities, in order to assess that efficacy and safety are preserved. Consequently, their costs are not very different from that of the originators and the economic gain coming from their use is reduced, especially if compared with that of generic drugs. This doesn't, however, explain why in most countries utilization of other biosimilars, as those used in rheumatology, hematology, and oncology, is growing and it is much greater than that of the originators: local health policy rules concerning prescription and reimbursement can play a role, similar to attitudes and barriers in physicians and in patients who can be misinformed about safety and efficacy of biosimilar insulins (15).\n\nIt is evident that biosimilars can be a useful instrument to overcome the \"insulin crisis\" and to reduce the global expenditure for diabetes care all over the world (16). This means that their use must be encouraged with initiatives from health care authorities such as those allowing a reduction of their costs, a preferential channel for prescription/reimbursement in comparison with originators, and incentives to their production and utilization. On the side of physicians and patients, a better information about efficacy and safety is clearly warranted. Putting together these and other indications, biosimilar insulin use will certainly grow and it will became a safe and effective way to reduce costs while preserving quality and efficacy of diabetes care, which perhaps is the best instrument against the \"insulin crisis.\"\n\n## Disclosure\n\nConflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The pathologist suggests monitoring of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) due to suspected trophoblastic disease. The cytogenetic exam showed a trisomy 15.\n\nForty days after hysterectomy, the patient had an hCG blood level of 1,258 mU/mL. In transvaginal ultrasound we found an intrauterine gestational sac with an embryo with cardiac activity; CRL measurement was 3.1 mm. The pregnancy proceeded regularly. The patient underwent an elective cesarean section 39 weeks due to the history of previous cesarean section. The baby was appropriate for gestational age with a normal pH after delivery. No placental afterbirth complications were noted. The histopathologic exam of placenta was normal.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nEPS is a non-neoplastic trophoblastic lesion characterized by exuberant infiltration of the myometrium by trophoblasts at the implantation site. This lesion was first defined as syncytial endometrits, but the term \"Exaggerated placental Site\" is now commonly used. EPS may develop secondary to a normal pregnancy, miscarriage, cervical pregnancy or hydididiform mole (1). The several reports describe the clinical course of EPS, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings or histopathological characteristics (3), but this case report is the first description of hysteroscopic findings of EPS.\n\nIn the present case we performed hysteroscopic surgery after miscarriage with detection of an unusual intracavitary topography and presentation of significant amount of gestational tissue. It has been shown that hysteroscopic approach is an effective routine and safe procedure based on the tissue removal inside the uterus; Cholkeri-Singh et al (4) have shown that the detection of fetal chromosomes obtained from direct hysteroembryoscopic biopsies resulted in more accurate karyotyping with lower maternal cell contamination than those obtained from curettage material.

This lesion was first defined as syncytial endometrits, but the term \"Exaggerated placental Site\" is now commonly used. EPS may develop secondary to a normal pregnancy, miscarriage, cervical pregnancy or hydididiform mole (1). The several reports describe the clinical course of EPS, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings or histopathological characteristics (3), but this case report is the first description of hysteroscopic findings of EPS.\n\nIn the present case we performed hysteroscopic surgery after miscarriage with detection of an unusual intracavitary topography and presentation of significant amount of gestational tissue. It has been shown that hysteroscopic approach is an effective routine and safe procedure based on the tissue removal inside the uterus; Cholkeri-Singh et al (4) have shown that the detection of fetal chromosomes obtained from direct hysteroembryoscopic biopsies resulted in more accurate karyotyping with lower maternal cell contamination than those obtained from curettage material. Hysteroscopic evacuation of the uterine cavity may reduce the D&C complication such as uterine perforation and endometrial damage in order to preserve future fertility.\n\nBy performing the procedure under direct visualization focusing on the implantation site, we can obtain precise sampling of trophoblastic tissue.

Most studies addressed filicide in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States [1].\n\nFurthermore, the study concerning filicide in Italy was carried out on samples of female murders [2,3]. On the contrary, still little is known about paternal filicide. The majority of the existing literature has focused on the comparison between maternal and paternal filicide, finding both differences and similarities. Bourget, Grace & Whitehurst [4], for example, found a common factor: the association between filicide and parental pre-existing psychiatric disorders, but also the presence of significant life stressors, social isolation, and lack of social support, and a history of abuse in childhood. \"Additional factors that differentiate filicidal fathers from filicidal mothers are: (1) fathers rarely commit nonaticide; (2) filicidal fathers are usually older; (3) filicidal fathers are more likely to have a history of violence toward their children; and (4) more fathers who commit filicide also commit suicide\" (p.79).\n\n\\(\\Lambda\\) secondary aspect that regards paternal filicide is the population studied. Marleau et al. [5] reported in detail 10 study cases of men who committed paternal filicide, hospitalized at the Institut Philippe Pinel de Montreal, Quebec, between 1982 and 1994. Even Bourget & Gagne [6] examined 77 cases of paternal filicide that occurred between 1991 and 2001 in Quebec, Canada. Liem & Koenraadt [7] conducted a similar study in the Netherlands for the period 1953-2004, with 79 men and 82 women having killed or attempted to kill their own child(ren).\n\nLiterature showed that psychopathological factors, notably severe mental health disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, are frequently implicated in these cases. The interplay of these disorders with psychoactive substance misuse significantly magnifies the risk, often disrupting cognitive and emotional regulation [8].\n\nConcurrently, socio-economic stressors, including unemployment and financial instability, emerge as pivotal contributors, exacerbating underlying psychological distress. The dynamic of interpersonal relationships, particularly in the context of familial discord or custodial disputes, often serves as a catalyst in the escalation toward filicide. Additionally, the presence of personality disorders characterized by impulsivity and affective instability notably increases the propensity for such acts [9].\n\nSocial isolation, an overlooked factor, significantly deprives individuals of essential support mechanisms, impeding effective coping strategies. Furthermore, the impact of historical trauma and post-traumatic stress, especially in populations with prior exposure to high-intensity stressors like combat, cannot be understated. In a subset of cases, filicide is driven by delusional cognitions or misperceptions regarding the child's well-being, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the father's mental state [10].\n\nHowever, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have focused on paternal filicide in the Italian context. Hence, the purpose of the present study is to identify the spatiotemporal coordinates, the characteristics of the author, the victims, and the context in which these murders take place to identify specific patterns of paternal filicide in Italy.\n\n**METHODS**\n\n_Study design and procedure_\n\nIn this retrospective design study, the data was collected through the major national newspapers, and all available information on the web was printed, crossed, and verified, raising the level of reliability of the information collected and allowing us to get a good grip on reality in quantity and quality. Our series consists of 76 homicidal events, which occurred in a familiar environment all over the country over a period of time between 1 January 1996 and 31 May 2012, with 76 authors and 134 victims. The murders examined do not constitute the totality of those that occurred. Still, they represent the vast majority, and the remarkably long period during which they occurred and the many variables examined allowed us to proceed with a thorough overview of a decade of paternal filicides in our country. The data collected, processed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 24.0), were analyzed by studying the evolution of the variables (for most categorical) using the Chi-square test and appropriately represented in frequency tables and graphical representations. As a result, to explore the relationship of association between groups of variables, Spearman ranks correlations. Finally, we compared groups of subjects, divided according to such victims involved (murder of children only vs. murder of children and spouse), to identify contextual differences concerning risk factors and murder mode.\n\n_Study instrument_\n\nThe data were collected through a structured grid, specifically conceived, consisting of four sections: (1) time-space coordinates; (2) the characteristics of the victims; (3) the characteristics of the offender; (4) characteristics of the murder.\n\n_Study sample_\n\nThe sample comprises 76 male authors aged between 25 and 63 (M = 40.9, SD = 7.6). Of these, 92.1% are Italian, and 6 are Italian citizens with foreign origins (one from Eastern Europe, one from another European country, two are Africans, and two are Asian). The victims are 134. The sample is divided into two subgroups: the cases in which only the children were killed (N = 37) and cases that also involved the author's wife - spouse/partner or former spouse/partner (N = 37). We excluded two cases from the comparison where other relatives were also involved. The intended victims (the children) are, therefore, 94, aged between 0 months and 14 years (M = 6.8, SD = 4.0).\n\n_Data analysis_\n\nRegarding risk factors for paternal filicide, we used the following categories: (1) _Abnormal lived_ cases in which the murder appears linked to a pathological lived fostered by a condition of psychiatric or existential suffering (incurable diseases, loneliness, old age); (2) _Separation or abandonment_, actual or dreaded: cases in which the murder is directly or indirectly related to problems, suffering, or anger related to a threatened or acted separation; (3) _Ongoing family conflict_. homicide cases in which the couple was in a situation of protracted animosity fostered by jealousy, abuse of power, conflicting economic interests, character incompatibility, difficulties of living together. To this category belongs also the \"fight or altercation\" in which the interpersonal relationship between the murderer and the victim, not distinguished by particular conflicts until the time of the murder, is suddenly disturbed by a transient situation of conflict, which triggers precisely the criminal fact; (4) _Existential practitioners_ and subcultural values: we have included in this category those cases in which the murder is the tragic end of life situations extremely poor or heavily influenced by the typical values of a behind subculture.\n\nUnivariate analysis explored the four areas related to the data collection grid, and then the variables considered were subsequently correlated and compared to the different groups that emerged. In the second step, we calculated the Spearman Rho correlations to analyze the relationships between 15 risk factors identified in the data collection.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n_Time-space coordinates_\n\nThe distribution of crime in the Italian Regions does not seem random (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 44.4, df = 15, p \\(<\\) 0.001). It focuses more on regions such as Lombardy and Lazio, followed by Emilia Romagna and Sicily. During the span considered, on average, almost 5 cases occur for each region. It is worth noting that there has been no filicide in some areas, such as in Molise, Umbria, Trentino, and Aosta Valley. When these data are classified according to the Istat division of the Italian regions, including North West (18 cases), Centre (18), North East (17), South (10), and Islands (10), no significant differences were found. Observing the frequency trend of murders over the 16 years examined, we can see that the paternal filicides in Italy are an average of four per year. Figure 1 shows two peaks, however, that can be observed: 2004 was the year in which the greatest frequency of cases was recorded, while 2005 and 1998 were the years with fewer episodes.\n\n As for the season, the highest concentration was observed during the winter months, especially in January (10.5%), February (13.2%) and March (13.7%), followed by September (10.5%). The season, in fact, with a higher incidence of paternal filicides was the Winter, with 51.3% of cases, while 23.7% occurred during the Summer. This incidence was statistically significant (\\(\\chi 2=30.6\\), df = 3, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\n_Victim's characteristics_\n\nThe intended victims, or the children, were 44 males and 50 females, aged \\(0\\) months to 14 years (M = 6.8, SD = 4.0). They were grouped into age ranges, and the significance of the impact of circumstances was verified: the prevailing range was the school age when sons are between 7 and 10 years. On the contrary, the youngest children were the least affected (\\(\\chi 2\\) = 20.2, df = 5, p \\(<0.001\\))\n\nThe majority of victims (91.5%) had Italian citizenship, only 3.2% were foreign children residing in Italy, and 5.2% were children of mixed marriages or unions. 77.9% of the victims lived in the same house as the father. The remaining part lived in a different house, presumably due to a separation or divorce. In most of the cases examined (N = 34, = 44.7%), victims were two: son/daughter and wife (76.5%), and the incidence is significant (\\(\\chi 2=33.8\\), df = 3, p \\(<0.001\\)),\n\nWhen it is killed, only the son/daughter (N = 28) in 67.9% of cases is an only child. In eight cases, however, only one child is killed, even if the author has two or more children. Incidentally, the sample is divided into two halves perfectly. Except for two cases in which other relatives were involved, we found that only 37 fathers killed the children exclusively, and 37 killed both children and wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner. For this reason, we analyzed the differences between the two groups concerning the possible risk factors involved and the potential methods of murder. Finally, it was noted also if the author has hurt - and then allegedly attempted to kill - other family members. In four cases, the author has attempted to kill his other children, who escaped from the murderous rampage.\n\nIn many cases, the murderer tried to kill his own wife and failed. In only one case, an acquaintance was wounded. This behavior seems to be related to the economic condition of the author: the greater the financial difficulties, the greater the attempts to make a family massacre (r = .226 *, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\n_Author's characteristics_\n\nThe authors of the filicides are 76, aged between 25 and 63 years (M = 40.9, SD = 7.6). Of these, 92.1% are Italian, only 6 are Italian citizens with foreign origins. The 68% of murdered fathers live in province areas rather than in large urban centers (\\(\\chi 2=10.3\\), df = 1, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\nThe 49% of the authors are involved in an occupation with low professional quality; 25% do not have a job, but only in 13.2% of cases is the reference to contingent economic difficulties (such as job loss) specified. Table 1 shows the occupations of the authors. As can be noticed, the most played an executive role as workman or employee. The professions that require a high intellectual profile and endorsements are rarely counted in familiar and paternal homicide cases (\\(\\chi 2=99.8\\), df = 11,\n\nFigure 1: Frequency of paternal filicides per year.\n\n p \\(<\\).001).\n\nRegarding employment status, 59.2% of the authors were employed, 25.4% were unemployed, 11.3% were occasionally employed, and 4.2% were retirees. Crossing the data, it emerged that successful suicide attempts are related to specific professions (* r = .241, p\\(<\\).001). More specifically, the higher the qualification, the higher the likelihood of suicide (r = .246 *, p \\(<\\).005). All teachers (2), military (4), and almost all traders (4 of 5) committed suicide. The most numerous are the workman fathers: on 28, 18 have committed suicide, and 5 have attempted suicide. Most of the fathers in our sample were married (56.6%), while 22% were separated or divorced. Considering the context of the murder, it emerges that cohabitants have a greater fear of abandonment. This element seems to be very specific: the younger the father, the greater the fear of loss (r = -.244 *, p \\(<\\).005), especially when the victim lives in a different residence from the father's one (* r = .268, p \\(<\\).005).\n\n_Honicide details_\n\nIn most cases, the degree of violence with which was the murder is relatively low (59.8%). As shown in Figure 2, firearms are the most used, 13 (48%) of which were regularly held.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l} \\hline\n**Fathers\u2019 Job** & **Frequency** & **Percentage** \\\\ \\hline Workman & 28 & 36.8 \\% \\\\ Executive employee & 12 & 15.8 \\% \\\\ Unemployed & 8 & 10.5 \\% \\\\ Freelance professional & 7 & 9.2 \\% \\\\ Retailer & 5 & 6.6 \\% \\\\ Conceptual employee & 4 & 5.3 \\% \\\\ Serviceperson & 4 & 5.3 \\% \\\\ Pitchman & 3 & 3.9 \\% \\\\ Teacher & 2 & 2.6 \\% \\\\ Various work & 1 & 1.3 \\% \\\\ Male nurse & 1 & 1.3 \\% \\\\ Other & 1 & 1.3 \\% \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Employment of the authors of filicide.\n\nFigure 2: Type of arms utilized in the paternal filicide.\n\n Once the flicide is completed, 58% of fathers committed suicide (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 20.7, df = 2, p \\(<\\) 0.001); 11 fathers have attempted suicide without carrying out the intention. Because of this, 82.9% of the authors don't give themselves up to authorities, despite those fathers who have not attempted suicide.\n\nA portion of the sample (26.3%) had left a letter, a ticket, or made a phone call to announce the gesture, inferring that the murder was premeditated. In 66.2% of cases, the crime of impulse can't be excluded (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 7.7, df = 1, p \\(<\\).005).\n\nWhere possible and clearly expressed in the news reported, we found some elements of the personal life of the author who may have acted as risk factors in the paternal filicide. Table 2 shows a large number of detected cases and the related impact significance.\n\nIn the second step, we calculated the Spearman Rho correlations to analyze the relationships between 15 risk factors identified in the data collection. The correlations show that criminal history is strongly and predictably related to sexual offenses (r = .327 **, p \\(<\\).001), violent behavior (r = .286 *, p \\(<\\).005), stalking (r = .239 *, p \\(<\\).005), and drug use (r = .468 **, p \\(<\\) 0.001). But the most interesting fact is that violent and persecutor behavior had been previously reported to the authorities (r = .409 **, p \\(<\\) 0.001).\n\nThe author's familiar violent behavior shows significant relationships with stalking (* r = .290, p \\(<\\) 0.005), gambling (which assumes an impulse control disorder) (r * = 235, p \\(<\\) 0.005), and organic disorders (r = .235 *, p \\(<\\).005). The latter, in fact, more easily commit a crime of impulse (r = .233 *, p \\(<\\).001).\n\nInstead, there is a negative relationship between violent behavior and psychosocial stressors: the more the author has suffered severe stress such as sorrow, job loss, economic hardship, or serious illness of his son's or wife, divorce, the less exhibit violent behavior (r = -.277 *, p \\(<\\).005).\n\nFurthermore, assessed correlations between risk factors and the methods of murder showed that when only children are killed, there is a greater fear of loss (r = -.240 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005) and stalking behaviors (r = .253 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005) against the ex-wife or partner. Finally, the greater the fear of loss, the lower the degree of violence (r = -.281 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005). These issues occur\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \\hline\n**Risk factors** & **Count** & **percentage** & **X 2 (df=1)** & **p value** \\\\ \\hline Fear of loss & 18 & 23.4 & 21.83 & .000 \\\\ Wife pathologies & 2 & 2.6 & 54.87 & .000 \\\\ Child pathologies & 6 & 7.8 & 68.21 & .000 \\\\ Criminal history & 15 & 19.7 & 27.84 & .000 \\\\ Sexual crimes & 4 & 5.3 & 60.84 & .000 \\\\ Reported mistreatments & 3 & 3.9 & 64.47 & .000 \\\\ Violent behaviour & 25 & 32.9 & 8.89 & .003 \\\\ Stalking & 3 & 3.9 & 64.47 & .000 \\\\ Drug use & 6 & 7.9 & 53.89 & .000 \\\\ Alcoholism & 4 & 5.3 & 60.84 & .000 \\\\ Gambling & 2 & 2.6 & 68.21 & .000 \\\\ Organic disease & 2 & 2.6 & 68.21 & .000 \\\\ Severe psychosocial stressors & 15 & 19.7 & 27.84 & .000 \\\\ Psychiatric disease & 31 & 40.8 & 2.5 & .108 \\\\ Anamnesis of psychiatric disease & 23 & 30.3 & 11.84 & .001 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Incidence of risk factors in the paternal filicides.\n\n with a significant incidence in cases where the child had a severe illness (r = - .248 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005). In these conditions, the murder takes place more likely in a public place, such as in a hospital (r = .413 **, p \\(<\\).001).\n\n_What are the differences between those who kill only children and those who kill children and wires?_\n\nExcept for two cases in which other relatives were involved, we found that 37 fathers killed their children exclusively, and 37 killed both the children and the wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner. For this reason, we analyzed the differences concerning the murder methods and the risk factors involved by comparing the two groups with the Mann and Whitney test. Concerning the methods of murder, the only variable that significantly differentiates the two groups is the fear of loss: the fathers distressed by the fear of losing their children tend to kill only the latter (U = 555, p \\(<\\) 0.05).\n\nThe tendency to kill only the children is also more common among fathers with specific employment status (U = 444, p \\(<\\) 0.03) ): on the one hand, they kill both sons and wives when employed (57%); on the other hand, fathers kill only the children when unemployed (55.6% of cases), retires (66.7%) and occasionally occupied (75%).\n\nIn relation instead to the risk factors, the fathers who had committed sexual offenses have killed both the children and the wife (U = 610.5, p \\(<\\)0.04). Finally, a significant correlation between the sex of the victim and the degree of violence was found (r = .262 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005): against female victims is exercised a greater degree of violence (U = 779, p\\(<\\) 0.01) and emerge more violent behavior (U = 546, p \\(<\\).02).\n\n**DISCussion**\n\nThe study has as its object the identification of the characteristics of fathers who committed filicide in Italy. Findings showed a higher prevalence in regions such as Lombardy and Lazio, followed by Emilia Romagna and Sicily. These correspond also to the most densely populated. Hence, we have reason to think that this result is proportionally connected to population density. As regards the year in which paternal filicide mostly occurred, emerged a higher incidence in Winter. Christmas is a significant holiday in Italy; this is the time of year when many families stay together, free from work and school.\n\nOn the other hand, the materialistic aspects of the holiday are associated with less happiness, more stress, and unpleasant effects. Ramsey [11] underlined that on holidays, homicide significantly increases. Findings regarding victims, on the other side, revealed that the prevailing range of the victims is the school age, between 7 and 10 years, and that the youngest children are the least affected. This result is consistent with the review conducted by Bourget, Grace & Whitehurst [4], in which it emerged that fathers, compared to mothers, rarely commit neonaticide.\n\nPaternal filicide emerged as having specific features. The majority of the little victims lived in the same house as the father. In fact, most of the fathers in our sample were married. This result is not self-evident. Being married is not an equivalent of being satisfied. Financial considerations are critical in whether a couple avoids separation or divorce but cannot prevent a familiar emotionally stressing climate, as stated by Carmela et al. [12]. In fact, one of the most important factors found in association with the murder of both son/daughter and wife was the economic difficulties, strictly linked to the attempts to make a family massacre.\n\nThe most popular employment found in the reference sample was the executive role - as a workman or employee. Professionals requiring an intellectual profile and endorsements rarely count in familiar and paternal homicide. Findings suggest that the higher the qualification, the higher the likelihood of suicide. Securing employment is critical to the psychosocial health of individuals. Job displacement or unemployment benefits were found to be associated with domestic violence [13]. We also found a relevant role played by age: the younger the father, the greater the fear of loss.\n\nIndeed, the fear of loss is the only variable that significantly differentiates the two groups identified, i.e., between fathers who have killed exclusively their children and fathers who killed both the children and the wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner, especially when the victim lives in a different residence from the father's one. Literature shows that the presence of a social father can play a protective role for young males [14]. In most cases, the degree of violence with which was the murder is relatively low. We observed that the more the author has suffered severe stress, such as sorrow, job loss, economic hardship, or serious illness of his son's or wife, or divorce, the less he exhibits violent behavior. These findings could indicate that homicide is guided by emotions such as sadness and depression despite anger or rage [15,16]. A review by Bruno et al. [10] demonstrated that paternal perinatal depression is underestimated and may predict mental disease comorbidities. The low degree of violence is also associated with a greater fear of loss and stalking behaviors against the ex-wife or partner, as if homicide is heavily influenced by fear and anguish - which, from a psychological point of view, is a mixed feeling composed by fear and sadness [17].\n\n## Conclusions\n\nPreventing violence means combating its cultural roots and causes by empowering family support. For this, political strategies aimed at education, raising awareness, and recognizing and realizing equal opportunities in every public and private sphere are essential (World Health Organization) [18]. Psychosocial interventions to reduce discrimination and stereotypes related to gender roles and sexism are needed since they produce the contextual conditions conducive to the perpetuation of male violence against women. In this regard, the focus must be on the younger generation and investing in psychosocial training [19].\n\nThe prevention actions supported by the Department of Equal Opportunities of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers through the National Strategic Framework therefore reflect the need to: 1) raise the level of awareness in public opinion about the structural roots, causes on the consequences of male violence against women; 2) strengthen the school system by improving the operational capacity of teachers and school staff on how to intercept, prevent, bring out and manage situations of violence, including witnessing violence [20]; 3) promote in the school's educational offerings gender equality education for overcoming gender roles and stereotypes, including through the revision of teaching and textbooks and the training of teaching staff at all levels; 4) train public and private social workers on phenomenology, interception, emergence, taking charge, assessment and management of cases of violence against women including those involving migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women; 5) strengthen preventive efforts against recidivism through pathways for the re-education of male perpetrators of violence and crimes related to male violence against women; 6) raise awareness in the private sector and the media about the influence of communication and advertising on issues such as gender stereotyping and sexism and their effects on the phenomenology of male violence against women and children [21,22].\n\nThe current research underscores the critical need for early identification and intervention of key risk factors to prevent paternal infanticide. This involves a comprehensive approach that includes recognizing psychological, social, and environmental indicators that might lead to such incidents. It advocates for the implementation of support systems, such as counseling and therapy, tailored to at-risk individuals. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of community awareness and education to aid in early detection. It calls for a collaborative effort across various sectors, including healthcare, social services, and law enforcement, to establish a supportive network for families. Furthermore, the research stresses the necessity of ongoing monitoring and support, alongside advocating for policy changes that focus on family protection and support [23]. By addressing underlying causes like mental health issues [8,24], substance abuse, and domestic challenges, the research aims to provide a holistic strategy to significantly understand the occurrence of paternal infanticide in Italy.\n\n \n\n**Author Contributions:** Conceptualization: GR, NR, LDV, AR; methodology: GR, NR, AR ; software: AR; validation: NR, GI, DC; formal analysis, NR and AR; investigation: NR, AR; resources: DC, GI; data curation: AR, NR; writing--original draft preparation: AR; writing--review and editing, AR, DC, GI; supervision: GR, LDV.

Most studies addressed filicide in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States [1].\n\nFurthermore, the study concerning filicide in Italy was carried out on samples of female murders [2,3]. On the contrary, still little is known about paternal filicide. The majority of the existing literature has focused on the comparison between maternal and paternal filicide, finding both differences and similarities. Bourget, Grace & Whitehurst [4], for example, found a common factor: the association between filicide and parental pre-existing psychiatric disorders, but also the presence of significant life stressors, social isolation, and lack of social support, and a history of abuse in childhood. \"Additional factors that differentiate filicidal fathers from filicidal mothers are: (1) fathers rarely commit nonaticide; (2) filicidal fathers are usually older; (3) filicidal fathers are more likely to have a history of violence toward their children; and (4) more fathers who commit filicide also commit suicide\" (p.79).\n\n\\(\\Lambda\\) secondary aspect that regards paternal filicide is the population studied. Marleau et al. [5] reported in detail 10 study cases of men who committed paternal filicide, hospitalized at the Institut Philippe Pinel de Montreal, Quebec, between 1982 and 1994. Even Bourget & Gagne [6] examined 77 cases of paternal filicide that occurred between 1991 and 2001 in Quebec, Canada. Liem & Koenraadt [7] conducted a similar study in the Netherlands for the period 1953-2004, with 79 men and 82 women having killed or attempted to kill their own child(ren).\n\nLiterature showed that psychopathological factors, notably severe mental health disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, are frequently implicated in these cases. The interplay of these disorders with psychoactive substance misuse significantly magnifies the risk, often disrupting cognitive and emotional regulation [8].\n\nConcurrently, socio-economic stressors, including unemployment and financial instability, emerge as pivotal contributors, exacerbating underlying psychological distress. The dynamic of interpersonal relationships, particularly in the context of familial discord or custodial disputes, often serves as a catalyst in the escalation toward filicide. Additionally, the presence of personality disorders characterized by impulsivity and affective instability notably increases the propensity for such acts [9].\n\nSocial isolation, an overlooked factor, significantly deprives individuals of essential support mechanisms, impeding effective coping strategies. Furthermore, the impact of historical trauma and post-traumatic stress, especially in populations with prior exposure to high-intensity stressors like combat, cannot be understated. In a subset of cases, filicide is driven by delusional cognitions or misperceptions regarding the child's well-being, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the father's mental state [10].\n\nHowever, to our knowledge, there are no studies that have focused on paternal filicide in the Italian context. Hence, the purpose of the present study is to identify the spatiotemporal coordinates, the characteristics of the author, the victims, and the context in which these murders take place to identify specific patterns of paternal filicide in Italy.\n\n**METHODS**\n\n_Study design and procedure_\n\nIn this retrospective design study, the data was collected through the major national newspapers, and all available information on the web was printed, crossed, and verified, raising the level of reliability of the information collected and allowing us to get a good grip on reality in quantity and quality. Our series consists of 76 homicidal events, which occurred in a familiar environment all over the country over a period of time between 1 January 1996 and 31 May 2012, with 76 authors and 134 victims. The murders examined do not constitute the totality of those that occurred. Still, they represent the vast majority, and the remarkably long period during which they occurred and the many variables examined allowed us to proceed with a thorough overview of a decade of paternal filicides in our country. The data collected, processed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 24.0), were analyzed by studying the evolution of the variables (for most categorical) using the Chi-square test and appropriately represented in frequency tables and graphical representations. As a result, to explore the relationship of association between groups of variables, Spearman ranks correlations. Finally, we compared groups of subjects, divided according to such victims involved (murder of children only vs. murder of children and spouse), to identify contextual differences concerning risk factors and murder mode.\n\n_Study instrument_\n\nThe data were collected through a structured grid, specifically conceived, consisting of four sections: (1) time-space coordinates; (2) the characteristics of the victims; (3) the characteristics of the offender; (4) characteristics of the murder.\n\n_Study sample_\n\nThe sample comprises 76 male authors aged between 25 and 63 (M = 40.9, SD = 7.6). Of these, 92.1% are Italian, and 6 are Italian citizens with foreign origins (one from Eastern Europe, one from another European country, two are Africans, and two are Asian). The victims are 134. The sample is divided into two subgroups: the cases in which only the children were killed (N = 37) and cases that also involved the author's wife - spouse/partner or former spouse/partner (N = 37). We excluded two cases from the comparison where other relatives were also involved. The intended victims (the children) are, therefore, 94, aged between 0 months and 14 years (M = 6.8, SD = 4.0).\n\n_Data analysis_\n\nRegarding risk factors for paternal filicide, we used the following categories: (1) _Abnormal lived_ cases in which the murder appears linked to a pathological lived fostered by a condition of psychiatric or existential suffering (incurable diseases, loneliness, old age); (2) _Separation or abandonment_, actual or dreaded: cases in which the murder is directly or indirectly related to problems, suffering, or anger related to a threatened or acted separation; (3) _Ongoing family conflict_. homicide cases in which the couple was in a situation of protracted animosity fostered by jealousy, abuse of power, conflicting economic interests, character incompatibility, difficulties of living together. To this category belongs also the \"fight or altercation\" in which the interpersonal relationship between the murderer and the victim, not distinguished by particular conflicts until the time of the murder, is suddenly disturbed by a transient situation of conflict, which triggers precisely the criminal fact; (4) _Existential practitioners_ and subcultural values: we have included in this category those cases in which the murder is the tragic end of life situations extremely poor or heavily influenced by the typical values of a behind subculture.\n\nUnivariate analysis explored the four areas related to the data collection grid, and then the variables considered were subsequently correlated and compared to the different groups that emerged. In the second step, we calculated the Spearman Rho correlations to analyze the relationships between 15 risk factors identified in the data collection.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\n_Time-space coordinates_\n\nThe distribution of crime in the Italian Regions does not seem random (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 44.4, df = 15, p \\(<\\) 0.001). It focuses more on regions such as Lombardy and Lazio, followed by Emilia Romagna and Sicily. During the span considered, on average, almost 5 cases occur for each region. It is worth noting that there has been no filicide in some areas, such as in Molise, Umbria, Trentino, and Aosta Valley. When these data are classified according to the Istat division of the Italian regions, including North West (18 cases), Centre (18), North East (17), South (10), and Islands (10), no significant differences were found. Observing the frequency trend of murders over the 16 years examined, we can see that the paternal filicides in Italy are an average of four per year. Figure 1 shows two peaks, however, that can be observed: 2004 was the year in which the greatest frequency of cases was recorded, while 2005 and 1998 were the years with fewer episodes.\n\n As for the season, the highest concentration was observed during the winter months, especially in January (10.5%), February (13.2%) and March (13.7%), followed by September (10.5%). The season, in fact, with a higher incidence of paternal filicides was the Winter, with 51.3% of cases, while 23.7% occurred during the Summer. This incidence was statistically significant (\\(\\chi 2=30.6\\), df = 3, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\n_Victim's characteristics_\n\nThe intended victims, or the children, were 44 males and 50 females, aged \\(0\\) months to 14 years (M = 6.8, SD = 4.0). They were grouped into age ranges, and the significance of the impact of circumstances was verified: the prevailing range was the school age when sons are between 7 and 10 years. On the contrary, the youngest children were the least affected (\\(\\chi 2\\) = 20.2, df = 5, p \\(<0.001\\))\n\nThe majority of victims (91.5%) had Italian citizenship, only 3.2% were foreign children residing in Italy, and 5.2% were children of mixed marriages or unions. 77.9% of the victims lived in the same house as the father. The remaining part lived in a different house, presumably due to a separation or divorce. In most of the cases examined (N = 34, = 44.7%), victims were two: son/daughter and wife (76.5%), and the incidence is significant (\\(\\chi 2=33.8\\), df = 3, p \\(<0.001\\)),\n\nWhen it is killed, only the son/daughter (N = 28) in 67.9% of cases is an only child. In eight cases, however, only one child is killed, even if the author has two or more children. Incidentally, the sample is divided into two halves perfectly. Except for two cases in which other relatives were involved, we found that only 37 fathers killed the children exclusively, and 37 killed both children and wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner. For this reason, we analyzed the differences between the two groups concerning the possible risk factors involved and the potential methods of murder. Finally, it was noted also if the author has hurt - and then allegedly attempted to kill - other family members. In four cases, the author has attempted to kill his other children, who escaped from the murderous rampage.\n\nIn many cases, the murderer tried to kill his own wife and failed. In only one case, an acquaintance was wounded. This behavior seems to be related to the economic condition of the author: the greater the financial difficulties, the greater the attempts to make a family massacre (r = .226 *, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\n_Author's characteristics_\n\nThe authors of the filicides are 76, aged between 25 and 63 years (M = 40.9, SD = 7.6). Of these, 92.1% are Italian, only 6 are Italian citizens with foreign origins. The 68% of murdered fathers live in province areas rather than in large urban centers (\\(\\chi 2=10.3\\), df = 1, p \\(<0.001\\)).\n\nThe 49% of the authors are involved in an occupation with low professional quality; 25% do not have a job, but only in 13.2% of cases is the reference to contingent economic difficulties (such as job loss) specified. Table 1 shows the occupations of the authors. As can be noticed, the most played an executive role as workman or employee. The professions that require a high intellectual profile and endorsements are rarely counted in familiar and paternal homicide cases (\\(\\chi 2=99.8\\), df = 11,\n\nFigure 1: Frequency of paternal filicides per year.\n\n p \\(<\\).001).\n\nRegarding employment status, 59.2% of the authors were employed, 25.4% were unemployed, 11.3% were occasionally employed, and 4.2% were retirees. Crossing the data, it emerged that successful suicide attempts are related to specific professions (* r = .241, p\\(<\\).001). More specifically, the higher the qualification, the higher the likelihood of suicide (r = .246 *, p \\(<\\).005). All teachers (2), military (4), and almost all traders (4 of 5) committed suicide. The most numerous are the workman fathers: on 28, 18 have committed suicide, and 5 have attempted suicide. Most of the fathers in our sample were married (56.6%), while 22% were separated or divorced. Considering the context of the murder, it emerges that cohabitants have a greater fear of abandonment. This element seems to be very specific: the younger the father, the greater the fear of loss (r = -.244 *, p \\(<\\).005), especially when the victim lives in a different residence from the father's one (* r = .268, p \\(<\\).005).\n\n_Honicide details_\n\nIn most cases, the degree of violence with which was the murder is relatively low (59.8%). As shown in Figure 2, firearms are the most used, 13 (48%) of which were regularly held.\n\n\nTable 1: Employment of the authors of filicide.\n\nFigure 2: Type of arms utilized in the paternal filicide.\n\n Once the flicide is completed, 58% of fathers committed suicide (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 20.7, df = 2, p \\(<\\) 0.001); 11 fathers have attempted suicide without carrying out the intention. Because of this, 82.9% of the authors don't give themselves up to authorities, despite those fathers who have not attempted suicide.\n\nA portion of the sample (26.3%) had left a letter, a ticket, or made a phone call to announce the gesture, inferring that the murder was premeditated. In 66.2% of cases, the crime of impulse can't be excluded (\\(\\chi\\)2 = 7.7, df = 1, p \\(<\\).005).\n\nWhere possible and clearly expressed in the news reported, we found some elements of the personal life of the author who may have acted as risk factors in the paternal filicide. Table 2 shows a large number of detected cases and the related impact significance.\n\nIn the second step, we calculated the Spearman Rho correlations to analyze the relationships between 15 risk factors identified in the data collection. The correlations show that criminal history is strongly and predictably related to sexual offenses (r = .327 **, p \\(<\\).001), violent behavior (r = .286 *, p \\(<\\).005), stalking (r = .239 *, p \\(<\\).005), and drug use (r = .468 **, p \\(<\\) 0.001). But the most interesting fact is that violent and persecutor behavior had been previously reported to the authorities (r = .409 **, p \\(<\\) 0.001).\n\nThe author's familiar violent behavior shows significant relationships with stalking (* r = .290, p \\(<\\) 0.005), gambling (which assumes an impulse control disorder) (r * = 235, p \\(<\\) 0.005), and organic disorders (r = .235 *, p \\(<\\).005). The latter, in fact, more easily commit a crime of impulse (r = .233 *, p \\(<\\).001).\n\nInstead, there is a negative relationship between violent behavior and psychosocial stressors: the more the author has suffered severe stress such as sorrow, job loss, economic hardship, or serious illness of his son's or wife, divorce, the less exhibit violent behavior (r = -.277 *, p \\(<\\).005).\n\nFurthermore, assessed correlations between risk factors and the methods of murder showed that when only children are killed, there is a greater fear of loss (r = -.240 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005) and stalking behaviors (r = .253 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005) against the ex-wife or partner. Finally, the greater the fear of loss, the lower the degree of violence (r = -.281 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005). These issues occur\n\n\nTable 2: Incidence of risk factors in the paternal filicides.\n\n with a significant incidence in cases where the child had a severe illness (r = - .248 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005). In these conditions, the murder takes place more likely in a public place, such as in a hospital (r = .413 **, p \\(<\\).001).\n\n_What are the differences between those who kill only children and those who kill children and wires?_\n\nExcept for two cases in which other relatives were involved, we found that 37 fathers killed their children exclusively, and 37 killed both the children and the wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner. For this reason, we analyzed the differences concerning the murder methods and the risk factors involved by comparing the two groups with the Mann and Whitney test. Concerning the methods of murder, the only variable that significantly differentiates the two groups is the fear of loss: the fathers distressed by the fear of losing their children tend to kill only the latter (U = 555, p \\(<\\) 0.05).\n\nThe tendency to kill only the children is also more common among fathers with specific employment status (U = 444, p \\(<\\) 0.03) ): on the one hand, they kill both sons and wives when employed (57%); on the other hand, fathers kill only the children when unemployed (55.6% of cases), retires (66.7%) and occasionally occupied (75%).\n\nIn relation instead to the risk factors, the fathers who had committed sexual offenses have killed both the children and the wife (U = 610.5, p \\(<\\)0.04). Finally, a significant correlation between the sex of the victim and the degree of violence was found (r = .262 *, p \\(<\\) 0.005): against female victims is exercised a greater degree of violence (U = 779, p\\(<\\) 0.01) and emerge more violent behavior (U = 546, p \\(<\\).02).\n\n**DISCussion**\n\nThe study has as its object the identification of the characteristics of fathers who committed filicide in Italy. Findings showed a higher prevalence in regions such as Lombardy and Lazio, followed by Emilia Romagna and Sicily. These correspond also to the most densely populated. Hence, we have reason to think that this result is proportionally connected to population density. As regards the year in which paternal filicide mostly occurred, emerged a higher incidence in Winter. Christmas is a significant holiday in Italy; this is the time of year when many families stay together, free from work and school.\n\nOn the other hand, the materialistic aspects of the holiday are associated with less happiness, more stress, and unpleasant effects. Ramsey [11] underlined that on holidays, homicide significantly increases. Findings regarding victims, on the other side, revealed that the prevailing range of the victims is the school age, between 7 and 10 years, and that the youngest children are the least affected. This result is consistent with the review conducted by Bourget, Grace & Whitehurst [4], in which it emerged that fathers, compared to mothers, rarely commit neonaticide.\n\nPaternal filicide emerged as having specific features. The majority of the little victims lived in the same house as the father. In fact, most of the fathers in our sample were married. This result is not self-evident. Being married is not an equivalent of being satisfied. Financial considerations are critical in whether a couple avoids separation or divorce but cannot prevent a familiar emotionally stressing climate, as stated by Carmela et al. [12]. In fact, one of the most important factors found in association with the murder of both son/daughter and wife was the economic difficulties, strictly linked to the attempts to make a family massacre.\n\nThe most popular employment found in the reference sample was the executive role - as a workman or employee. Professionals requiring an intellectual profile and endorsements rarely count in familiar and paternal homicide. Findings suggest that the higher the qualification, the higher the likelihood of suicide. Securing employment is critical to the psychosocial health of individuals. Job displacement or unemployment benefits were found to be associated with domestic violence [13]. We also found a relevant role played by age: the younger the father, the greater the fear of loss.\n\nIndeed, the fear of loss is the only variable that significantly differentiates the two groups identified, i.e., between fathers who have killed exclusively their children and fathers who killed both the children and the wife, ex-wife, partner, or ex-partner, especially when the victim lives in a different residence from the father's one. Literature shows that the presence of a social father can play a protective role for young males [14]. In most cases, the degree of violence with which was the murder is relatively low. We observed that the more the author has suffered severe stress, such as sorrow, job loss, economic hardship, or serious illness of his son's or wife, or divorce, the less he exhibits violent behavior. These findings could indicate that homicide is guided by emotions such as sadness and depression despite anger or rage [15,16]. A review by Bruno et al. [10] demonstrated that paternal perinatal depression is underestimated and may predict mental disease comorbidities. The low degree of violence is also associated with a greater fear of loss and stalking behaviors against the ex-wife or partner, as if homicide is heavily influenced by fear and anguish - which, from a psychological point of view, is a mixed feeling composed by fear and sadness [17].\n\n## ", "Conclusions": "\n\nPreventing violence means combating its cultural roots and causes by empowering family support. For this, political strategies aimed at education, raising awareness, and recognizing and realizing equal opportunities in every public and private sphere are essential (World Health Organization) [18]. Psychosocial interventions to reduce discrimination and stereotypes related to gender roles and sexism are needed since they produce the contextual conditions conducive to the perpetuation of male violence against women. In this regard, the focus must be on the younger generation and investing in psychosocial training [19].\n\nThe prevention actions supported by the Department of Equal Opportunities of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers through the National Strategic Framework therefore reflect the need to: 1) raise the level of awareness in public opinion about the structural roots, causes on the consequences of male violence against women; 2) strengthen the school system by improving the operational capacity of teachers and school staff on how to intercept, prevent, bring out and manage situations of violence, including witnessing violence [20]; 3) promote in the school's educational offerings gender equality education for overcoming gender roles and stereotypes, including through the revision of teaching and textbooks and the training of teaching staff at all levels; 4) train public and private social workers on phenomenology, interception, emergence, taking charge, assessment and management of cases of violence against women including those involving migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women; 5) strengthen preventive efforts against recidivism through pathways for the re-education of male perpetrators of violence and crimes related to male violence against women; 6) raise awareness in the private sector and the media about the influence of communication and advertising on issues such as gender stereotyping and sexism and their effects on the phenomenology of male violence against women and children [21,22].\n\nThe current research underscores the critical need for early identification and intervention of key risk factors to prevent paternal infanticide. This involves a comprehensive approach that includes recognizing psychological, social, and environmental indicators that might lead to such incidents. It advocates for the implementation of support systems, such as counseling and therapy, tailored to at-risk individuals. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of community awareness and education to aid in early detection. It calls for a collaborative effort across various sectors, including healthcare, social services, and law enforcement, to establish a supportive network for families. Furthermore, the research stresses the necessity of ongoing monitoring and support, alongside advocating for policy changes that focus on family protection and support [23]. By addressing underlying causes like mental health issues [8,24], substance abuse, and domestic challenges, the research aims to provide a holistic strategy to significantly understand the occurrence of paternal infanticide in Italy.\n\n \n\n**Author Contributions:** Conceptualization: GR, NR, LDV, AR; methodology: GR, NR, AR ; software: AR; validation: NR, GI, DC; formal analysis, NR and AR; investigation: NR, AR; resources: DC, GI; data curation: AR, NR; writing--original draft preparation: AR; writing--review and editing, AR, DC, GI; supervision: GR, LDV.

This procedure was imperative for evaluating the presence of thrombi in the right atrial appendage before an endoscopic closure of the appendage, particularly due to her history of atrial fibrillation and recent cerebral hemorrhage while on anticoagulant therapy. This case highlights the inherent risks associated with TEE, especially in the elderly with complicating factors such as osteophytic changes and a history of anticoagulation, but also underscores the importance of thorough pre-procedural assessment and careful monitoring. Our findings align with the literature, emphasizing the elevated risk of esophageal injury in elderly patients during TEE and the need for heightened vigilance in this population.\n\n15 December 2023\n\n## Case Description\n\nThe patient, an \\(80\\)-year-old female with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, was scheduled for a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) examination. This procedure was crucial as a preoperative assessment for the proposed endoscopic closure of her right atrial appendage. The closure was deemed necessary due to her history of atrial fibrillation, which had been complicated by a recent fall resulting in cerebral hemorrhage. Additionally, the patient was on anticoagulant therapy to manage her atrial fibrillation, increasing her stroke risk and necessitating the closure procedure.\n\nAt the time of the TEE, the patient was conscious with stable vital signs. However, her recent cerebral hemorrhage and ongoing anticoagulation therapy presented unique challenges and risks for the procedure. The TEE was vital in determining the suitability for the atrial appendage closure, a common intervention to reduce stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nDuring the TEE, the patient was under conscious sedation. The procedure was initially reported as uneventful. However, within a few hours post-examination, the patient began to experience severe symptoms indicative of a possible esophageal injury. He complained of acute onset of chest pain, radiating to the back, and dysphagia, indicating difficulty in swallowing, both of which are not typical for him. The chest pain was described as sharp and worsened with swallowing movements.\n\nGiven these symptoms, the medical team promptly initiated a diagnostic workup. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, which revealed the presence of air and fluid collection around the esophageal region, indicative of an esophageal perforation. Additionally, there was evidence of mediastinal widening, a common complication of esophageal perforation due to the spread of esophageal contents into the mediastum.\n\nThe patient was immediately started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to prevent infection, and nil per os (NPO) status was initiated to rest the esophagus. Surgical consultation was sought, and the patient was taken to the operating room for an emergency surgical perforation repair. A thorough examination of the esophagus during surgery confirmed the presence of a perforation in the mid-thoracic esophagus.\n\nPost-surgical management was critical for this patient due to his advanced age and the complexity of the esophageal injury. The patient was closely monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively. Nutritional support was initially managed with enteral feeding through a nasogastric tube, followed by a gradual reintroduction of oral intake once the esophagus was healed on follow-up imaging and endoscopy.\n\nThis case highlights the importance of recognizing the potential risks associated with TEE, especially in the elderly population. Despite the relative rarity of esophageal perforation following TEE, its occurrence necessitates prompt diagnosis and intervention to minimize morbidity and mortality associated with this severe complication.\n\n## Discussion\n\nEsophageal perforation as a consequence of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is an uncommon but grave complication. Herbold and colleagues retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for esophageal perforation and included all patients with perforation caused by TEE. They found that \"in 6 patients (5.5%), the perforation was caused by TEE\" and \"all patients underwent successful endoscopic treatment.\" All patients underwent successful endoscopic treatment, and no further surgical procedure, such as esophageal suture or resection, was necessary. They showed how esophageal perforations caused by TEE are typically small in the cervical and mid esophagus and minimally contaminated and the potential for successful management through endoscopic treatment [3]. The systematic review by Sainathan & Andaz [4] on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-induced esophageal perforation showed two key points: firstly, that TEE-induced esophageal perforation typically occurs in elderly female patients, predominantly in an intra-operative setting, and secondly, that the majority of these perforations occur in the thoracic esophagus, especially during intra-operative TEE procedures. In literature, some large retrospective trials suggested that patient factors (age, body mass index, anatomic abnormalities), comorbid conditions (previous stroke), and procedural variables (procedure time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, etc.) are associated with TEE-related injuries [5].\n\nThese findings are particularly relevant to our case report, underscoring the demographic and procedural contexts in which such complications most frequently arise. While cases of TEE-induced esophageal perforation in the elderly are not extensively reported in the literature, their clinical significance is profound. Age-related changes in esophageal tissue integrity, as well as pre-existing medical conditions, can substantially increase the vulnerability of older patients to such injuries.\n\nFor instance, Bavalia and colleagues [6] reported a case of esophageal perforation in a 77-year-old woman undergoing TEE, where chronic steroid therapy for asthma symptoms and osteophytic changes of the cervical vertebrae were identified as contributing factors to her increased risk of perforation. This case, among others, highlights the importance of a thorough pre-procedural assessment of the elderly. It is crucial to consider not just age but also the presence of comorbidities and other risk factors that might predispose an individual to esophageal trauma during TEE.\n\nIn discussing the role of age as a risk factor for esophageal perforation during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), it's important to consider the findings of Royer et al. in their 2020 study [5]. Their case report and literature review, focusing on an elderly patient with prominent vertebral osteophytes who experienced esophageal perforation following TEE, highlight the increased risk in older patients. The study underscores that age-related anatomical changes, such as the presence of vertebral osteophytes, can contribute to the complexity and risk of TEE procedures. This finding is particularly relevant to our case report involving an 80-year-old patient. It suggests that elderly patients may have unique anatomical and physiological characteristics predisposing them to complications during invasive procedures like TEE. The study by Royer et al. (2020) supports the notion that advanced age and specific age-related conditions should be considered significant risk factors when planning and conducting TEE [7].\n\nTherefore, this case emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation of TEE's risks and benefits in elderly patients, especially those with known risk factors for esophageal injury. It underscores the importance of individualized patient care, where decisions regarding procedures like TEE are made considering the unique health profiles of elderly patients. The management of esophageal perforation requires a swift and coordinated approach, as demonstrated in our case. Prompt surgical intervention was crucial in addressing the esophageal tear, followed by comprehensive postoperative care. This care included antibiotic therapy to prevent infection and tailored nutritional support, initially via enteral feeding, to ensure adequate healing and recovery. Regular follow-up with endoscopies and imaging studies was essential in monitoring the patient's progress and detecting any potential complications at an early stage. Despite the age-related challenges and the urgency of the surgical intervention, our patient exhibited a notably positive recovery trajectory, without significant long-term complications. This outcome can be attributed to the prompt recognition of the perforation, the immediate surgical response, and the meticulous postoperative management.\n\nOur case highlights the importance of vigilance during TEE, especially considering the subtle nature of symptoms that may initially manifest in cases of esophageal injury. Early detection and management are key to preventing severe morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, this case emphasizes the need for enhanced awareness among clinicians regarding the potential risks of TEE in the elderly. It also calls for developing and implementing strategies to minimize these risks, possibly including refined procedural techniques, the use of protective measures, and the selection of alternative diagnostic modalities when appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while esophageal perforation following TEE is a rare occurrence, it is a serious complication that warrants consideration, especially in older patients. Our experience with this case reinforces the necessity for continuous vigilance, rapid intervention in the face of complications, and a multidisciplinary approach to care to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients undergoing TEE.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nIn conclusion, this case report underscores the critical need for heightened vigilance and individualized care in managing elderly patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). It highlights the importance of considering both age and comorbidities as risk factors for esophageal perforation. In this case, the successful outcome achieved through prompt recognition and appropriate management demonstrates the possibility of favorable recovery, even in complex scenarios. This case reminds healthcare professionals to remain cautious and proactive in identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with diagnostic procedures in the elderly population.\n\n**Author Contributions:** Conceptualization: GN; investigation: GN, GP, FC, MM; writing--original draft preparation: GN; writing--review and editing, GP, FC, MM; supervision: AB; project administration: AB.

However, there are disparities in the enrolment rate due to compositional and contextual factors [2]. Gendered patterns of healthcare services utilization within urban and rural contexts, income and wealth quintiles, and effects emanating from educational levels and cognitive factors tend to influence enrolment at the individual level; health insurance enrolment among men in Ghana remains relatively low. The seemingly patriarchy tendencies in most developing countries and power dynamics among men usually facilitate the neglect of critical academic inquiry into ex-ante coping strategies employed to address their healthcare needs. In the case of Ghana, the existence of a voluntary national health insurance scheme and the volition to freely enroll in any privately regulated health insurance scheme leave the choice of enrolment in the will of individuals and adult household members, where men tend to be the major decision-makers [3]. Enshrined in the national health insurance scheme based on the National Health Insurance (NHIS) Act 2012 (Act 852) is an insurance premium component that denies the automatic enrolment of all people resident in Ghana regardless of the pluralistic fund mobilization strategies in the scheme [4-6]. Hence, individuals are likely influenced by sociodemographic and locational factors [7,8]. It has been argued that to achieve equity and the pro-poor objectives in the Ghana health insurance system, it is necessary to understand the issues design and implement such interventions appropriately [9].\n\nFurther, it has been expressed that the absence of compulsory insurance enrolment, annual enrolment and renewal arrangements, and the discretionary determination of exempted groups apart from Lvelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) beneficiaries tend to serve as barriers to enrolment [9,18,19]. Central in the literature on health insurance enrolment has been the arguments on quality of care, facility, adequacy of benefit packages, price, and convenience [1]. However, delving deeper is the potential of selected geo-demographic elements that directly and indirectly influence the perception factors. This study explores the predictive ability of sociodemographic elements such as age, education level, income level, and geo-referenced variables such as ethnicity, rural/urban residence, and region as predictors of NHIS enrolment. Thus, this study explores the predictive effects of selected categorical variables in two ordinal logistic models using data from a micro-indicator cluster study in Ghana.\n\n## Methods\n\nThis study uses primary data from the Ghana Micro Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017/2018 to analyze the relationship between selected sociodemographic and locational variables and health insurance enrolment among men aged 15-49 years in Ghana. The data sources, variables measured, and analyses have been presented.\n\nTo provide estimates for many indicators on the situation of diverse demographic groups at the national level, rural and urban areas, and existing administrative regions, the Ghana Statistical Service undertook a micro indicator cluster survey (MICS) in 2017/2018. A multi-stage sampling frame was used to classify urban and rural areas in each region as the significant sampling strata. Subsequently, it employed a two-stage approach in selecting households established in basic enumeration units by the 2010 population and housing census. A systematic sampling approach determined 20 households in each enumeration unit where survey questionnaires were administered. Specifically, this study employed the questionnaire for individual men in every second household to all men aged 15-49 years. In all, 5,476 were eligible for the survey. However, 5,323, representing 97.2%, took part in the survey. Further, establishing ordinal logistics resulted in using responses from 4,309 respondents after excluding missing responses.\n\n_Measured items and analysis_\n\nThis study used items on the men's background, marriage/union, and adult functioning. The dependent variable, health insurance enrolment, was denoted by health insurance coverage. The independent variables were age group, men'seducational level, marital status, wealth index quintile, and functional difficulty, which served as compositional attributes tested in Model 1. The constructs on ethnicity, urban and rural residence, and geographic region were added as the contextual factors in Model 2.\n\nThe enumerated compositional and contextual variables were tested as the main predictive factors of health insurance coverage in two multivariable ordinal logistic models based on existing and established statistical benchmarks. The models employed the use of odd ratio (OR) and p-values to interpret the relationship in the categories of the measured items, which were not held to be redundant in the model. The models were established after an item correlation analysis using Spearman's rho correlation since the measured items were binary and categorical. The acquisition of significant correlation values was based on Spearman's rho correlation values and statistically significant values of either p\\(<\\)0.001 or \\(<\\)0.005. In establishing model goodness of fit, the deviance/df of 1.255 and chi-square/df of 1.050 were analyzed with the omnibus test results of p\\(<\\)0.001. The results section presents the descriptive outcome and the co-efficient in regression analysis.\n\n_Ethical aspects_\n\nUNICEF and the Ghana Statistical Service obtained verbal consent from each respondent participating. The right to use the data was granted to the Author by the Ghana Statistical Service after approval of the data request protocols. The standard guidelines can be found at http://mics.unicef.org/tools#data-processing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe findings from the study are subsequently discussed. The descriptive dimension involves an analysis of the frequency and percentage variables used for the research. In all, a total of 4,309 respondent men between the ages of 15 to 49 years who participated in the study were used in the analysis.\n\nThe frequency from the dependent variable, which is health insurance coverage, showed that 1,764 (40.9%) respondents had valid health insurance (HI) coverage, whereas 2,545 (59.1%) did not have health insurance coverage. Regarding age categorization, the ages between 15 and 24 constituted 1,410 (32.7%), whereas the oldest age category of 44 to 49 years constituted 534 (12.4%). Further, the age data showed a gradual decline in respondents based on age progression, which is coterminous with the national population pyramid. The categorical variable on men's education level showed that 659 (15.3%) had pre-primary or no formal education, whereas primary and junior secondary/middle school constituted 538 (12.4%) and 1,414 (32.8%), respectively. Further, senior secondary and tertiary or higher education included 1,181 (27.4%) and 517 (12%), respectively. The identification of men in marital unions showed that 2,415 (56%) were in marital unions at the time of the survey, whereas 161 (3.7%) of the respondents had formerly been married. Moreover, 1,733 (40.2%) of the men had never married or been in union.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Variable** & **Measured Item** & **N** & **Percent (\\%)** \\\\ \\hline \\hline Covered by health insurance & Yes & 176 & 40.9\\% \\\\  & & 4 & \\\\  & No & 254 & 59.1\\% \\\\  & & 5 & \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Age Group & 15 to 24 years & 141 & 32.7\\% \\\\  & & \\(0\\) & \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 1: Frequency distribution of sociodemographic variables.\n\n \n\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & 25 to 34 years & 128 & 29.8\\% \\\\  & & 5 & \\\\  & 35 to 44 years & 108 & 25.1\\% \\\\  & & 0 & \\\\  & 44 to 49 years & 534 & 12.4\\% \\\\  & & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Man's Education & Pre-primary or none & 659 & 15.3\\% \\\\  & Primary & 538 & 12.5\\% \\\\  & JSS/JHS/Middle & 141 & 32.8\\% \\\\  & & 4 & \\\\  & SSS/SHS/ Secondary & 118 & 27.4\\% \\\\  & & 1 & \\\\  & Higher & 517 & 12.0\\% \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\  & Currently married/in union & 241 & 56.0\\% \\\\  & & 5 & \\\\  & Formerly married/in union & 161 & 3.7\\% \\\\  & Never married/in a union & 173 & 40.2\\% \\\\  & & 3 & \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\  & Weakly index quintile & Poorest & 109 & 25.3\\% \\\\  & & 0 & \\\\  & Second & 677 & 15.7\\% \\\\  & Middle & 732 & 17.0\\% \\\\  & Fourth & 811 & 18.8\\% \\\\  & Richest & 999 & 23.2\\% \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Functional difficulties & Has functional difficulty & 231 & 5.4\\% \\\\ (age 18-49 years) & Has no functional difficulty & 407 & 94.6\\% \\\\  & & 8 & \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Ethnicity of household head & Akan & 157 & 36.6\\% \\\\  & & 8 & \\\\  & GA/Damgme & 307 & 7.1\\% \\\\  & Ewe & 538 & 12.5\\% \\\\  & Guan & 148 & 3.4\\% \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe parameter on wealth quintile, ascribed in literature as influencing the ability to pay for health insurance coverage, depicted that 1,090 (25.8%) of the respondents were in the poorest wealth quintile. The second and middle wealth index quintile constitute 677 (15.7%) and 732 (17%). 811 (18.8%) and 999 (23.2%) respondents were in the fourth and richest wealth index quintiles. The inclusive objectives of health insurance programs necessitated the examination of functional difficulty as part of the independent variables. It was observed that 231 (5.4%) of the respondents had functional problems. The descriptive statistics on the ethnicity of male household heads in the study were also obtained. Further, the area was represented by 1,950 (45.3%) and 2,359 (59.7%) of respondents living in rural and urban areas respectively. The regional data revealed that Greater Accra and Ashanti had relatively higher respondent numbers of 537 (12.5%) and 560 (13%).\n\nFurther, descriptive analysis was conducted among all the 5,476 respondents surveyed on the type of health insurance coverage before proceeding with inferential statistics on 4,309 respondents generated after the excluded cases. National health insurance coverage constituted 2,266 (41.4%), whereas health insurance through an employer constituted 20 (0.4%). Other privately purchased commercial health insurance were 14 (0.3%).\n\nMore importantly, the individual reasons why some respondents never registered with private insurance or NHIS were analyzed. From the survey, respondents who felt premiums were too high were 108 (2%), whereas lack of confidence in health insurance scheme operation was 82 (1.5%). The absence of knowledge of any health insurance scheme constituted 23 (0.4%), while the lack of understanding of where to register was 22 (0.4%). Other views on long distances of registration were 111 (2.1%), whereas 285 (5.2%) of the respondents did not find a need for health insurance. Further reasons include limited service or facility coverage, which constituted 58 (1.1%), and no money for enrollment, indicated by 509 (9.3%) of the respondents.\n\nThe findings from the demographic variables and subsequent observations made from the reasons assigned by respondents necessitate an examination of the effect of the antecedent compositional and contextual variables on the dependent variable of health insurance cover by first establishing a Spearman rho correlation due to the presence of binary and categorical data type and secondly ascertain the levels of effect through two multivariable ordinal logistic regression models after the goodness of fit indices have been demonstrated. The correlation results showed that age group and rural/urban residence, herein referred to as area, positively correlated with health insurance coverage, as shown by correlation values of 0.044 and 0.110 at p\\(<\\)0.001, respectively.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l l}  & **Covered by** & **Age** & **Man\u2019s** & **Marital** & **WIQ Functional** & **Ethnicity Area** & **Region** \\\\  & **HI** & **group** & **Education** & **status** & **Status** & **Household** & \\\\  & & & & & **(18-49 years)** & **head** & \\\\ \\hline\n**Covered by HI** & 1.000 & & & & & & \\\\ \\hline\n**Age group** & .044\\({}^{\\text{-}}\\) & 1.000 & & & & & \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 2: Spearman\u2019s rho correlation analysis.\n\nFigure 1: Reasons for non-enrolment of health insurance among men.\n\n Though most of the independent variables negatively correlated with health insurance coverage, there was a solid inter-item correlation among some of the independent variables. The primary objective of employing ordinal logistic regression models to ascertain the effects led to the setting up of two models made up of social demographic variables serving as the predictors of health insurance cover in model 1 and the subsequent establishment of an interactive model made up of both sociodemographic and contextual factors serving as predictors of health insurance cover in model 2. The goodness of fit indicators showed a deviance value/df of 1.255 and a chi-square value/df of 1.050. The omnibus test showed a significant value of p\\(<\\)0.001. In the model effect, only functional difficulty (disability) did not have a statistically significant effect, as demonstrated by p=0.771; the remaining independent variables had significant p\\(<\\)0.001 or p\\(<\\)0.005.\n\n_Ordinal logistic regression results_\n\nThe results from Model 1, which analyzed the effects of age group, education level, marital status, wealth index quintile, and functional difficulty as the main sociodemographic factors influencing health insurance coverage, revealed the existence of relationships. Within the age parameters, while holding the oldest category of 44 to 49 years redundant, respondents aged 15 to 24 had an odd ratio of 1.127 with a lower bound Wald interval of 0.863 and upper bound of 1.473. Progressively, ages 25 to 35 saw an odd ratio of 1.437 with a p-value of 0.002. The ages between 35 and 44 years saw an odd ratio of 1.066 with a lower bound of 0.857 and an upper bound of 1.325. Men's education level showed a relatively higher effect on health insurance coverage as signified by odd ratios 2.943, 3.914, 3.201, and 2.030, all at p\\(<\\)0.001 for Pre-Primary, Primary, JHS, and SHS levels, respectively. The responses under marital status also demonstrated the existence of a positive odd ratio of 1.043 and 1.856, with the latter being those formerly married having a significant statistical value of 0.002.\n\nFurther, all elements under the wealth index quintile coincided with health insurance coverage, with only the poorest category showing a relatively lower odd ratio of 1.453 with p\\(<\\)0.005. The remaining quintiles showed a higher odd ratio and p\\(<\\)0.001. However, although the element of functional difficulty had an odd ratio of 1.081, it did not have a statistically significant value. The lack of finality in the effects of the demographic variables on the dependent variable augments the inclusion of contextual variables _sin quo non_, hence the establishment of Model 2.\n\nThe findings from Model 2 reveal a slight progressive effect of the age variables. Similarly, men's education level continues to be a key determinant of health insurance coverage with an improved add ratio, with the highest having a 3.932 odd ratio with p\\(<\\)001. Marital status had a relatively lower odd ratio in Model 2 than in Model 1. However, there was a significant improvement in the effects of the parameters under the wealth index, as shown by the observance of higher odd ratios ranging from 2.659 to 1.684, all at p\\(<\\)0.001. In Model 2, it was still observed that though functional difficulty had an odd ratio of 0.956, it did not have a statistically significant value.\n\n \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline\n**Parameter** & **Model 1** & & & & **Model 2** & & & \\\\\n**Estimates** & & & & & & & & \\\\ Parameter & Exp(B) & 95\\% & Wald & Confidence & p- & Exp(B) & 95\\% & Wald & Confidence & p-value \\\\  & & Interval for Exp(B) & value & & & Interval for Exp(B) & & \\\\  & & Lower & Upper & & & Lower & Upper & \\\\ \\hline\n**Age Group** & & & & & & & & \\\\\n15 To 24 Years & 1.127 & .863 & 1.473 & .380 & 1.112 & .841 & 1.470 & .456 \\\\\n25 To 34 Years & 1.437 & 1.148 & 1.799 & .002 & 1.463 & 1.158 & 1.848 & .001 \\\\\n35 To 44 Years & 1.066 & .857 & 1.325 & .565 & 1.090 & .870 & 1.367 & .454 \\\\\n44 To 49 Years & 1 & - & - & - & 1 & - & - & . \\\\\n**Education Level** & & & & & & & \\\\ Pre-Primary & Or & 2.943 & 2.208 & 3.921 & .000 & 3.458 & 2.551 & 4.687 & .000 \\\\ None & & & & & & & \\\\ Primary & 3.914 & 2.931 & 5.227 & .000 & 3.932 & 2.905 & 5.321 & .000 \\\\ JSS/JHS/Middle & 3.201 & 2.541 & 4.033 & .000 & 2.647 & 2.079 & 3.372 & .000 \\\\ SSS/SHS/ & 2.030 & 1.619 & 2.546 & .000 & 1.907 & 1.506 & 2.413 & .000 \\\\ Secondary & & & & & & & \\\\ Higher & 1 & . & - & - & 1 & - & . \\\\\n**Marital Status** & & & & & & & \\\\ Currently & 1,043 & .862 & 1.263 & .664 & .965 & .790 & 1.179 & .729 \\\\ Married/In Union & & & & & & & \\\\ Formerly & 1.856 & 1.253 & 2.750 & .002 & 1.557 & 1.033 & 2.348 & .035 \\\\ Married/In Union & & & & & & & \\\\ Never & Married/In & 1 & . & - & - & 1 & - & . \\\\ Union & & & & & & & \\\\\n**Wealth Index** & & & & & & & \\\\ Poorest & 1.453 & 1.173 & 1.800 & .001 & 2.659 & 1.996 & 3.542 & .000 \\\\ Second & 1.879 & 1.502 & 2.350 & .000 & 2.534 & 1.926 & 3.334 & .000 \\\\ Middle & 1.738 & 1.406 & 2.148 & .000 & 2.007 & 1.583 & 2.545 & .000 \\\\ Fourth & 1.523 & 1.251 & 1.855 & .000 & 1.684 & 1.367 & 2.074 & .000 \\\\ Richest & 1 & - & - & - & 1 & - & . \\\\ Functional Difficulty & & & & & & & \\\\ Has & Functional & 1.081 & .810 & 1.443 & .597 & .956 & .705 & 1.296 & .771 \\\\ Difficulty & & & & & & & \\\\ Has & No & Functional & 1 & - & - & 1 & - & . & . \\\\ Difficulty & & & & & & & \\\\\n**Ethnicity** & & & & & & & \\\\ Akan & & & & & 1.602 & .098 & 26.193 & .741 \\\\ Ga/Damgme & & & & & 2.029 & .123 & 33.435 & .621 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\nTable 3: Ordinal logistic regression model.\n\n_AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH_ (_International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health_)\n\nhttps://ampphaalthjournal-network.org\n\nEwe\n\n1.872\n\n.114\n\n.661\n\n.1818\n\n.108\n\n.108\n\n.678\n\n.683\n\n.050\n\n13.859\n\n.899\n\n.1988\n\n.122\n\n.32.494\n\n.630\n\n.678\n\n.684\n\n.685\n\n.772\n\n.039\n\n15.350\n\n.865\n Introducing the contextual or geo-related variables of ethnicity, area (rural/urban), and regional location generally improved the predictive abilities of the previous sociodemographic factors. Preceding that improvement, the parameters under ethnicity had higher odd ratios; however, none of the parameters under this construct had a significant p-value. Departing from ethnicity, rural/urban residence showed an odd ratio of 0.828 with a lower Wald interval of 0.695 and an upper Wald interval of 0.987 at a p-value of 0.036. Subsequently, most of the parameters under regional location had the highest odd ratio, with a region exhibiting an odd ratio of 7.456 with a lower bound of 4.938 and an upper bound of 11.258 at p\\(<\\)0.001. Thus, the interplay of sociodemographic and geo-related factors accentuates the tendency of health insurance enrolment among men in this study.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe study explored the effects of selected compositional and contextual factors on men's health insurance coverage using data obtained through a nationally representative micro indicator cluster survey. The preliminary section of the results presented a descriptive analysis of the frequency and percentages of the measured items. The selection of age, education level, wealth index quintile, and marital status as key sociodemographic determinants of health insurance enrolment were supported by existing studies [1, 6, 8]. However, this study delves deeper into examining the influence of these variables on a mono-gender group, herein being men between the ages of 15 to 49 years.\n\nThe inclusion of functional difficulty among men as an independent variable in this study was to help ascertain the effect of the parameter as a critical instrument for achieving the inclusive and pro-poor objectives of Ghana's national health insurance scheme. Concerning the innate reasons behind the non-subscription to health insurance schemes, it was observed that high premium packages did not account for the significant reason. This can be attributed to the pluralistic sources of funding for the health insurance scheme, where the majority of the covered respondents had subscriptions, as indicated by 41.4% of the men surveyed. However, lack of money to register for insurance in private and public schemes constituted the main reason among 9.3% of the respondents, followed by the reasons for not requiring insurance. It can be deduced from the findings that the majority of the respondents knew of a health insurance scheme. However, lack of confidence in the scheme's operation, as signified by 1.5%, and the issue of far proximity to the registration office, as indicated by 2.1% of the total respondents surveyed, were cited as reasons for never registering for health insurance. By and large, the data obtained from the reasons did not account for the considerable gap between the currently enrolled respondents, who are 40.9%, and non-enrolled respondents, who are 59.1%. Hence, there is a need for an extensive examination of the sociodemographic and context-specific underpinning factors behind health insurance coverage among men.\n\nSpearman's rho correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between age and health insurance coverage and a similar relationship between rural/urban residence and health insurance coverage. These findings are consistent with the findings of several authors [1, 10, 11], who found a similar relationship between these demographic and contextual factors and health insurance enrolment within general demographics.\n\nSubsequently, establishing two multivariable ordinal logistic regression models testing the effects of the sociodemographic variables in one dimension and proceeding to compound the sociodemographic and contextual variables in the second model led to observing significant predictive impacts of some of the constructs. At 95% confidence intervals, it was observed that educational level and wealth index quintile were the most important predictors of health insurance coverage among men in Model 1, as signified by an odd ratio of 3.914, 95% CI, \\(2.931-5.227\\); p \\(=0.000\\), and odd ratio of 1.879; 95% CI, \\(1.502-2.350\\); p \\(=0.000\\) for education level and wealth index respectively. This implies that while other variables in the model are held constant, higher education or wealth will increase the odds of men having health insurance coverage in Ghana.\n\n Further, the addition of ethnicity, rural/urban area of residence, and regional location as contextual factors in model 2 revealed an improved effect of the existing sociodemographic variables except for functional difficulty, which was still insignificant. The insignificance of functional difficulty may be attributed to existing national policies that target the exemption of vulnerable groups from paying for national health insurance schemes and programs such as the Livedihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) [9, 12, 13]. More importantly, it was ascertained that ethnicity was not a significant predictor of health insurance coverage in the study. Mainly seen as a social solidarity and a tool for national and political cohesion, the national health insurance scheme, which the respondents assert as the main health insurance subscribed in this study, does not adversely select voluntary subscribers based on ethnic affiliation and hence the observance of these results.\n\nThe findings also showed that rural-urban residence significantly predicts health insurance coverage among men in this study. Urbanization can create access to healthcare facilities while enhancing proximity and reducing travel time to obtain health insurance registration and services. Finally, most of the parameters under region demonstrate that the regional construct was a significant predictor of health insurance coverage among men. The variations in regional levels of development and disparities in healthcare resources could account for the greater odd ratios and non-statically significant values observed in a few regions.\n\n_Study limitation_\n\nThe study acknowledges the significance of gender equity and social inclusion considerations in research. However, this paper predominantly focuses on the relatively low health insurance enrollment of men in Ghana and within the context of most developing countries. The reasonably significant low health insurance enrolment among men, coupled with deep-seated adverse socio-cultural norms, may have spiral effects on health outcomes among men and other demographic groups. Hence, there is a need for considerable health marketing and financing strategies in research, segmentation, and targeting efforts to advance the discourse on individual, household, and communal level health insurance policies.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe study explored the relationship between selected compositional and contextual attributes and health insurance enrolment among men while not overlooking the perceived reasons for never subscribing to health insurance coverage. While acknowledging the relative dominance of men in communal and household decision-making as a result of deeply entrenched patriarchy and power dynamics in the study context, patterns of low health insurance coverage among the respondents revealed levels of vulnerabilities and gendered tendencies associated with enrolment in health insurance service. Though all men were interviewed in this study, variances in sociodemographic and context-specific factors led to differential effects in men's health insurance coverage. As developing countries strive to achieve universal health coverage for the greater population, it is crucial to consider segmentation and targeting of diverse population groups at the micro level and critically examine sociodemographic and locational dynamics that can influence acceptance and subscription to ex-ante coping mechanisms that can mitigate the financial burden associated with healthcare cost and at the same time enhance strategies put forward to promote universal healthcare coverage. Thus, efforts to improve health insurance coverage among men should focus on improving opportunities for general education, wealth, and residential equality in health insurance registration and healthcare delivery services.\n\n**Funding: This research was funded by UNICEF, under an agreement with the Ghana Statistical Service.**\n\n**Acknowledgments: The Author is grateful to all participants and the Ghana Statistical Service for granting access to the data and approving the use of the data**\n\n**Conflicts of Interest: The Author declares no conflict of interest.** _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH (International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health)_https://ampphhealthjournal-network.org\n\n**Disclaimer/Publisher's Note:** The Publisher remains neutral regarding jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.

However, there are disparities in the enrolment rate due to compositional and contextual factors [2]. Gendered patterns of healthcare services utilization within urban and rural contexts, income and wealth quintiles, and effects emanating from educational levels and cognitive factors tend to influence enrolment at the individual level; health insurance enrolment among men in Ghana remains relatively low. The seemingly patriarchy tendencies in most developing countries and power dynamics among men usually facilitate the neglect of critical academic inquiry into ex-ante coping strategies employed to address their healthcare needs. In the case of Ghana, the existence of a voluntary national health insurance scheme and the volition to freely enroll in any privately regulated health insurance scheme leave the choice of enrolment in the will of individuals and adult household members, where men tend to be the major decision-makers [3]. Enshrined in the national health insurance scheme based on the National Health Insurance (NHIS) Act 2012 (Act 852) is an insurance premium component that denies the automatic enrolment of all people resident in Ghana regardless of the pluralistic fund mobilization strategies in the scheme [4-6]. Hence, individuals are likely influenced by sociodemographic and locational factors [7,8]. It has been argued that to achieve equity and the pro-poor objectives in the Ghana health insurance system, it is necessary to understand the issues design and implement such interventions appropriately [9].\n\nFurther, it has been expressed that the absence of compulsory insurance enrolment, annual enrolment and renewal arrangements, and the discretionary determination of exempted groups apart from Lvelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) beneficiaries tend to serve as barriers to enrolment [9,18,19]. Central in the literature on health insurance enrolment has been the arguments on quality of care, facility, adequacy of benefit packages, price, and convenience [1]. However, delving deeper is the potential of selected geo-demographic elements that directly and indirectly influence the perception factors. This study explores the predictive ability of sociodemographic elements such as age, education level, income level, and geo-referenced variables such as ethnicity, rural/urban residence, and region as predictors of NHIS enrolment. Thus, this study explores the predictive effects of selected categorical variables in two ordinal logistic models using data from a micro-indicator cluster study in Ghana.\n\n## Methods\n\nThis study uses primary data from the Ghana Micro Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2017/2018 to analyze the relationship between selected sociodemographic and locational variables and health insurance enrolment among men aged 15-49 years in Ghana. The data sources, variables measured, and analyses have been presented.\n\nTo provide estimates for many indicators on the situation of diverse demographic groups at the national level, rural and urban areas, and existing administrative regions, the Ghana Statistical Service undertook a micro indicator cluster survey (MICS) in 2017/2018. A multi-stage sampling frame was used to classify urban and rural areas in each region as the significant sampling strata. Subsequently, it employed a two-stage approach in selecting households established in basic enumeration units by the 2010 population and housing census. A systematic sampling approach determined 20 households in each enumeration unit where survey questionnaires were administered. Specifically, this study employed the questionnaire for individual men in every second household to all men aged 15-49 years. In all, 5,476 were eligible for the survey. However, 5,323, representing 97.2%, took part in the survey. Further, establishing ordinal logistics resulted in using responses from 4,309 respondents after excluding missing responses.\n\n_Measured items and analysis_\n\nThis study used items on the men's background, marriage/union, and adult functioning. The dependent variable, health insurance enrolment, was denoted by health insurance coverage. The independent variables were age group, men'seducational level, marital status, wealth index quintile, and functional difficulty, which served as compositional attributes tested in Model 1. The constructs on ethnicity, urban and rural residence, and geographic region were added as the contextual factors in Model 2.\n\nThe enumerated compositional and contextual variables were tested as the main predictive factors of health insurance coverage in two multivariable ordinal logistic models based on existing and established statistical benchmarks. The models employed the use of odd ratio (OR) and p-values to interpret the relationship in the categories of the measured items, which were not held to be redundant in the model. The models were established after an item correlation analysis using Spearman's rho correlation since the measured items were binary and categorical. The acquisition of significant correlation values was based on Spearman's rho correlation values and statistically significant values of either p\\(<\\)0.001 or \\(<\\)0.005. In establishing model goodness of fit, the deviance/df of 1.255 and chi-square/df of 1.050 were analyzed with the omnibus test results of p\\(<\\)0.001. The results section presents the descriptive outcome and the co-efficient in regression analysis.\n\n_Ethical aspects_\n\nUNICEF and the Ghana Statistical Service obtained verbal consent from each respondent participating. The right to use the data was granted to the Author by the Ghana Statistical Service after approval of the data request protocols. The standard guidelines can be found at http://mics.unicef.org/tools#data-processing.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nThe findings from the study are subsequently discussed. The descriptive dimension involves an analysis of the frequency and percentage variables used for the research. In all, a total of 4,309 respondent men between the ages of 15 to 49 years who participated in the study were used in the analysis.\n\nThe frequency from the dependent variable, which is health insurance coverage, showed that 1,764 (40.9%) respondents had valid health insurance (HI) coverage, whereas 2,545 (59.1%) did not have health insurance coverage. Regarding age categorization, the ages between 15 and 24 constituted 1,410 (32.7%), whereas the oldest age category of 44 to 49 years constituted 534 (12.4%). Further, the age data showed a gradual decline in respondents based on age progression, which is coterminous with the national population pyramid. The categorical variable on men's education level showed that 659 (15.3%) had pre-primary or no formal education, whereas primary and junior secondary/middle school constituted 538 (12.4%) and 1,414 (32.8%), respectively. Further, senior secondary and tertiary or higher education included 1,181 (27.4%) and 517 (12%), respectively. The identification of men in marital unions showed that 2,415 (56%) were in marital unions at the time of the survey, whereas 161 (3.7%) of the respondents had formerly been married. Moreover, 1,733 (40.2%) of the men had never married or been in union.\n\n\nTable 1: Frequency distribution of sociodemographic variables.\n\n \n\n\\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & 25 to 34 years & 128 & 29.8\\% \\\\  & & 5 & \\\\  & 35 to 44 years & 108 & 25.1\\% \\\\  & & 0 & \\\\  & 44 to 49 years & 534 & 12.4\\% \\\\  & & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Man's Education & Pre-primary or none & 659 & 15.3\\% \\\\  & Primary & 538 & 12.5\\% \\\\  & JSS/JHS/Middle & 141 & 32.8\\% \\\\  & & 4 & \\\\  & SSS/SHS/ Secondary & 118 & 27.4\\% \\\\  & & 1 & \\\\  & Higher & 517 & 12.0\\% \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\  & Currently married/in union & 241 & 56.0\\% \\\\  & & 5 & \\\\  & Formerly married/in union & 161 & 3.7\\% \\\\  & Never married/in a union & 173 & 40.2\\% \\\\  & & 3 & \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\  & Weakly index quintile & Poorest & 109 & 25.3\\% \\\\  & & 0 & \\\\  & Second & 677 & 15.7\\% \\\\  & Middle & 732 & 17.0\\% \\\\  & Fourth & 811 & 18.8\\% \\\\  & Richest & 999 & 23.2\\% \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Functional difficulties & Has functional difficulty & 231 & 5.4\\% \\\\ (age 18-49 years) & Has no functional difficulty & 407 & 94.6\\% \\\\  & & 8 & \\\\  & **Total** & **430** & **100.0\\%** \\\\  & & **9** & \\\\ Ethnicity of household head & Akan & 157 & 36.6\\% \\\\  & & 8 & \\\\  & GA/Damgme & 307 & 7.1\\% \\\\  & Ewe & 538 & 12.5\\% \\\\  & Guan & 148 & 3.4\\% \\\\ \\end{tabular}\n\nThe parameter on wealth quintile, ascribed in literature as influencing the ability to pay for health insurance coverage, depicted that 1,090 (25.8%) of the respondents were in the poorest wealth quintile. The second and middle wealth index quintile constitute 677 (15.7%) and 732 (17%). 811 (18.8%) and 999 (23.2%) respondents were in the fourth and richest wealth index quintiles. The inclusive objectives of health insurance programs necessitated the examination of functional difficulty as part of the independent variables. It was observed that 231 (5.4%) of the respondents had functional problems. The descriptive statistics on the ethnicity of male household heads in the study were also obtained. Further, the area was represented by 1,950 (45.3%) and 2,359 (59.7%) of respondents living in rural and urban areas respectively. The regional data revealed that Greater Accra and Ashanti had relatively higher respondent numbers of 537 (12.5%) and 560 (13%).\n\nFurther, descriptive analysis was conducted among all the 5,476 respondents surveyed on the type of health insurance coverage before proceeding with inferential statistics on 4,309 respondents generated after the excluded cases. National health insurance coverage constituted 2,266 (41.4%), whereas health insurance through an employer constituted 20 (0.4%). Other privately purchased commercial health insurance were 14 (0.3%).\n\nMore importantly, the individual reasons why some respondents never registered with private insurance or NHIS were analyzed. From the survey, respondents who felt premiums were too high were 108 (2%), whereas lack of confidence in health insurance scheme operation was 82 (1.5%). The absence of knowledge of any health insurance scheme constituted 23 (0.4%), while the lack of understanding of where to register was 22 (0.4%). Other views on long distances of registration were 111 (2.1%), whereas 285 (5.2%) of the respondents did not find a need for health insurance. Further reasons include limited service or facility coverage, which constituted 58 (1.1%), and no money for enrollment, indicated by 509 (9.3%) of the respondents.\n\nThe findings from the demographic variables and subsequent observations made from the reasons assigned by respondents necessitate an examination of the effect of the antecedent compositional and contextual variables on the dependent variable of health insurance cover by first establishing a Spearman rho correlation due to the presence of binary and categorical data type and secondly ascertain the levels of effect through two multivariable ordinal logistic regression models after the goodness of fit indices have been demonstrated. The correlation results showed that age group and rural/urban residence, herein referred to as area, positively correlated with health insurance coverage, as shown by correlation values of 0.044 and 0.110 at p\\(<\\)0.001, respectively.\n\n\nTable 2: Spearman\u2019s rho correlation analysis.\n\nFigure 1: Reasons for non-enrolment of health insurance among men.\n\n Though most of the independent variables negatively correlated with health insurance coverage, there was a solid inter-item correlation among some of the independent variables. The primary objective of employing ordinal logistic regression models to ascertain the effects led to the setting up of two models made up of social demographic variables serving as the predictors of health insurance cover in model 1 and the subsequent establishment of an interactive model made up of both sociodemographic and contextual factors serving as predictors of health insurance cover in model 2. The goodness of fit indicators showed a deviance value/df of 1.255 and a chi-square value/df of 1.050. The omnibus test showed a significant value of p\\(<\\)0.001. In the model effect, only functional difficulty (disability) did not have a statistically significant effect, as demonstrated by p=0.771; the remaining independent variables had significant p\\(<\\)0.001 or p\\(<\\)0.005.\n\n_Ordinal logistic regression results_\n\nThe results from Model 1, which analyzed the effects of age group, education level, marital status, wealth index quintile, and functional difficulty as the main sociodemographic factors influencing health insurance coverage, revealed the existence of relationships. Within the age parameters, while holding the oldest category of 44 to 49 years redundant, respondents aged 15 to 24 had an odd ratio of 1.127 with a lower bound Wald interval of 0.863 and upper bound of 1.473. Progressively, ages 25 to 35 saw an odd ratio of 1.437 with a p-value of 0.002. The ages between 35 and 44 years saw an odd ratio of 1.066 with a lower bound of 0.857 and an upper bound of 1.325. Men's education level showed a relatively higher effect on health insurance coverage as signified by odd ratios 2.943, 3.914, 3.201, and 2.030, all at p\\(<\\)0.001 for Pre-Primary, Primary, JHS, and SHS levels, respectively. The responses under marital status also demonstrated the existence of a positive odd ratio of 1.043 and 1.856, with the latter being those formerly married having a significant statistical value of 0.002.\n\nFurther, all elements under the wealth index quintile coincided with health insurance coverage, with only the poorest category showing a relatively lower odd ratio of 1.453 with p\\(<\\)0.005. The remaining quintiles showed a higher odd ratio and p\\(<\\)0.001. However, although the element of functional difficulty had an odd ratio of 1.081, it did not have a statistically significant value. The lack of finality in the effects of the demographic variables on the dependent variable augments the inclusion of contextual variables _sin quo non_, hence the establishment of Model 2.\n\nThe findings from Model 2 reveal a slight progressive effect of the age variables. Similarly, men's education level continues to be a key determinant of health insurance coverage with an improved add ratio, with the highest having a 3.932 odd ratio with p\\(<\\)001. Marital status had a relatively lower odd ratio in Model 2 than in Model 1. However, there was a significant improvement in the effects of the parameters under the wealth index, as shown by the observance of higher odd ratios ranging from 2.659 to 1.684, all at p\\(<\\)0.001. In Model 2, it was still observed that though functional difficulty had an odd ratio of 0.956, it did not have a statistically significant value.\n\n \n\n\nTable 3: Ordinal logistic regression model.\n\n_AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH_ (_International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health_)\n\nhttps://ampphaalthjournal-network.org\n\nEwe\n\n1.872\n\n.114\n\n.661\n\n.1818\n\n.108\n\n.108\n\n.678\n\n.683\n\n.050\n\n13.859\n\n.899\n\n.1988\n\n.122\n\n.32.494\n\n.630\n\n.678\n\n.684\n\n.685\n\n.772\n\n.039\n\n15.350\n\n.865\n Introducing the contextual or geo-related variables of ethnicity, area (rural/urban), and regional location generally improved the predictive abilities of the previous sociodemographic factors. Preceding that improvement, the parameters under ethnicity had higher odd ratios; however, none of the parameters under this construct had a significant p-value. Departing from ethnicity, rural/urban residence showed an odd ratio of 0.828 with a lower Wald interval of 0.695 and an upper Wald interval of 0.987 at a p-value of 0.036. Subsequently, most of the parameters under regional location had the highest odd ratio, with a region exhibiting an odd ratio of 7.456 with a lower bound of 4.938 and an upper bound of 11.258 at p\\(<\\)0.001. Thus, the interplay of sociodemographic and geo-related factors accentuates the tendency of health insurance enrolment among men in this study.\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe study explored the effects of selected compositional and contextual factors on men's health insurance coverage using data obtained through a nationally representative micro indicator cluster survey. The preliminary section of the results presented a descriptive analysis of the frequency and percentages of the measured items. The selection of age, education level, wealth index quintile, and marital status as key sociodemographic determinants of health insurance enrolment were supported by existing studies [1, 6, 8]. However, this study delves deeper into examining the influence of these variables on a mono-gender group, herein being men between the ages of 15 to 49 years.\n\nThe inclusion of functional difficulty among men as an independent variable in this study was to help ascertain the effect of the parameter as a critical instrument for achieving the inclusive and pro-poor objectives of Ghana's national health insurance scheme. Concerning the innate reasons behind the non-subscription to health insurance schemes, it was observed that high premium packages did not account for the significant reason. This can be attributed to the pluralistic sources of funding for the health insurance scheme, where the majority of the covered respondents had subscriptions, as indicated by 41.4% of the men surveyed. However, lack of money to register for insurance in private and public schemes constituted the main reason among 9.3% of the respondents, followed by the reasons for not requiring insurance. It can be deduced from the findings that the majority of the respondents knew of a health insurance scheme. However, lack of confidence in the scheme's operation, as signified by 1.5%, and the issue of far proximity to the registration office, as indicated by 2.1% of the total respondents surveyed, were cited as reasons for never registering for health insurance. By and large, the data obtained from the reasons did not account for the considerable gap between the currently enrolled respondents, who are 40.9%, and non-enrolled respondents, who are 59.1%. Hence, there is a need for an extensive examination of the sociodemographic and context-specific underpinning factors behind health insurance coverage among men.\n\nSpearman's rho correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between age and health insurance coverage and a similar relationship between rural/urban residence and health insurance coverage. These findings are consistent with the findings of several authors [1, 10, 11], who found a similar relationship between these demographic and contextual factors and health insurance enrolment within general demographics.\n\nSubsequently, establishing two multivariable ordinal logistic regression models testing the effects of the sociodemographic variables in one dimension and proceeding to compound the sociodemographic and contextual variables in the second model led to observing significant predictive impacts of some of the constructs. At 95% confidence intervals, it was observed that educational level and wealth index quintile were the most important predictors of health insurance coverage among men in Model 1, as signified by an odd ratio of 3.914, 95% CI, \\(2.931-5.227\\); p \\(=0.000\\), and odd ratio of 1.879; 95% CI, \\(1.502-2.350\\); p \\(=0.000\\) for education level and wealth index respectively. This implies that while other variables in the model are held constant, higher education or wealth will increase the odds of men having health insurance coverage in Ghana.\n\n Further, the addition of ethnicity, rural/urban area of residence, and regional location as contextual factors in model 2 revealed an improved effect of the existing sociodemographic variables except for functional difficulty, which was still insignificant. The insignificance of functional difficulty may be attributed to existing national policies that target the exemption of vulnerable groups from paying for national health insurance schemes and programs such as the Livedihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP) [9, 12, 13]. More importantly, it was ascertained that ethnicity was not a significant predictor of health insurance coverage in the study. Mainly seen as a social solidarity and a tool for national and political cohesion, the national health insurance scheme, which the respondents assert as the main health insurance subscribed in this study, does not adversely select voluntary subscribers based on ethnic affiliation and hence the observance of these results.\n\nThe findings also showed that rural-urban residence significantly predicts health insurance coverage among men in this study. Urbanization can create access to healthcare facilities while enhancing proximity and reducing travel time to obtain health insurance registration and services. Finally, most of the parameters under region demonstrate that the regional construct was a significant predictor of health insurance coverage among men. The variations in regional levels of development and disparities in healthcare resources could account for the greater odd ratios and non-statically significant values observed in a few regions.\n\n_Study limitation_\n\nThe study acknowledges the significance of gender equity and social inclusion considerations in research. However, this paper predominantly focuses on the relatively low health insurance enrollment of men in Ghana and within the context of most developing countries. The reasonably significant low health insurance enrolment among men, coupled with deep-seated adverse socio-cultural norms, may have spiral effects on health outcomes among men and other demographic groups. Hence, there is a need for considerable health marketing and financing strategies in research, segmentation, and targeting efforts to advance the discourse on individual, household, and communal level health insurance policies.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nThe study explored the relationship between selected compositional and contextual attributes and health insurance enrolment among men while not overlooking the perceived reasons for never subscribing to health insurance coverage. While acknowledging the relative dominance of men in communal and household decision-making as a result of deeply entrenched patriarchy and power dynamics in the study context, patterns of low health insurance coverage among the respondents revealed levels of vulnerabilities and gendered tendencies associated with enrolment in health insurance service. Though all men were interviewed in this study, variances in sociodemographic and context-specific factors led to differential effects in men's health insurance coverage. As developing countries strive to achieve universal health coverage for the greater population, it is crucial to consider segmentation and targeting of diverse population groups at the micro level and critically examine sociodemographic and locational dynamics that can influence acceptance and subscription to ex-ante coping mechanisms that can mitigate the financial burden associated with healthcare cost and at the same time enhance strategies put forward to promote universal healthcare coverage. Thus, efforts to improve health insurance coverage among men should focus on improving opportunities for general education, wealth, and residential equality in health insurance registration and healthcare delivery services.\n\n**Funding: This research was funded by UNICEF, under an agreement with the Ghana Statistical Service.**\n\n**Acknowledgments: The Author is grateful to all participants and the Ghana Statistical Service for granting access to the data and approving the use of the data**\n\n**Conflicts of Interest: The Author declares no conflict of interest.** _AMPPH_ is published by the _INAMPPH (International Network for the Advancement of Medicine, Psychology and Public Health)_https://ampphhealthjournal-network.org\n\n**Disclaimer/Publisher's Note:** The Publisher remains neutral regarding jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
